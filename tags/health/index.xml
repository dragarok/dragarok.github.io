      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all identify our bodies as &amp;ldquo;my body&amp;rdquo; and &lt;strong&gt;not me directly&lt;/strong&gt;. The whole idea of this blog post revolves around this idea. The purpose of this blog post is to establish an idea on how to build healthier lifestyle based on this concept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not like we intentionally don&amp;rsquo;t want to build healthier habits. We try to pick up exercise habits, but we are too lazy to work on it. We eat haphazardly, and without any consideration to our health. It&amp;rsquo;s a very universal problem. So, I had the same problem. On top of that, I have always been a person low in Conscientiousness, which means I used to have a hard time pushing my goals to myself if I was the only one responsible for it. Finally, I found a way that worked for me that might work for you too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
