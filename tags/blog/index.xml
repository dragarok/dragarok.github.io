      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you think about world from good mental models, you&amp;rsquo;ve already recognized that traditional structures in this world are falling. Be it Politics, Business, Education and so on. As if a switch was pressed, and it started getting more and more random. Ray Dalio has written a book on &amp;ldquo;The Changing World Order&amp;rdquo;. With close observation, its hard to not take a note.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previously, money and leverage were tied to very non-random outcomes. There are decentralized commodities. Now, look at what altcoins and crypto is doing. One person is grinding their entire life saving pennies, and there&amp;rsquo;s another one who gains and loses like a gambling game. But if you look closely enough, its a form of currency we have accepted and used. So, you are a part of that gambling match whether you know crypto or not. Big countries might adapt it, and a lot of lives change. Big countries make it illegal, and a lot of lives change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025 Yearly Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;!!&amp;rdquo; I want to start with an exclamation. This year has been one of that year that I had been waiting for decades to happen to me. From the year 2023, it finally crossed the Tipping Point and started getting crazier.&#xA;There were parts about my identity that I really got to explore, go deep into, and really uncover myself piece by piece. Like going petal by petal in a lotus flower. 🪷&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Satya Poem: After a decade</title>
      <link>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2025/10/satya-poem-after-a-decade/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The context is this: I wrote this poem as an extension of my emotions 10 years ago.&#xA;The poem&amp;rsquo;s titled &amp;ldquo;Satya&amp;rdquo; and was the first poem on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neither am I a poet, nor a storyteller. I wrote what I genuinely felt at that time. And this was close to when Gadhimai Mela was about to happen and there was a lot of news about &lt;strong&gt;Bali Pratha&lt;/strong&gt; needing to stop and so on. It triggered something that was already brewing inside me vehemently, into words. This is my commentary on my own writing after 10 years of seeking, learning, and coming home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First I was innocent,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I asked for an identity,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;The world pushed me down and pained me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I talked to the world about this pain,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And the world mocked me.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I felt alone in this fight,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I wanted to run away.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;But, she didn&#39;t let me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;She made me break into a thousand pieces,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;But always took great care that none was lost.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And when I gave up,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;She made me work on myself.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And That&#39;s how I recollected myself to be wholler than the whole.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;-------------------------------xx-------------------------------&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Second I was in limelight,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I asked for strength,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Then the eyes of the world fixated at me pained me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Their dreams, their expectations,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Them trying to fulfill their dreams through me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I again talked to the world about the burden of expectations,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And the world really didn&#39;t care.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I felt alone again in this fight,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I wanted to run away.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;But, she didn&#39;t let me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;She made me take even more burden until I broke again,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Yet she took great care again that none was lost.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And when I gave up,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;She made me work on myself.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And That&#39;s how I recollected myself to be wholler than the whole again.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;-------------------------------xx-------------------------------&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, I was now strong enough to take any burden.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I asked for truth,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I started wandering here and there in search of truth,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;The words from thousand masters buzzed like a bomb inside my head.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;But by now, I knew the world never listened.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;So I chose a few I was hoping would listen without judgement,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Tried telling them about the never ending search,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Yet they too didn&amp;rsquo;t get much.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Love</title>
      <link>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2023/10/on-love/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2023/10/on-love/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to write some essays on basic words that are the hardest to capture because often times it&amp;rsquo;s these words that stir up conflict: love, happiness, fulfillment, peace, pain, god,  spirituality etc.&#xA;Because they are the most overused, yet least understood by our subconscious minds, our subconscious gets trippy while making sense.&#xA;I started writing this essay about six months ago.  In trying to write this essay, I started by searching for word love in my personal notes vault. It got overwhelming even after a day digesting, that I gave up the pursuit for some time. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t have any digest apart from notes and excerpts from others. I knew where to start, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t end it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
