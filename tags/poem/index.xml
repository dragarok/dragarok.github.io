      <description>Peak Peak they saw, Thought they made, Of the day when their steps would be on the mountain peak, Clear seem&amp;rsquo;d they, Of the goal they desperately seek.
Guided by the river trail, Dreams flew high against the flow, The mountains of hope: deep and strong first, Now saw the wind of fear that slowly blow.
The path feels rough now, The silent howls of people&amp;rsquo;s voice he heard, Of those who got lost on that way, And of those who sought to walk away.</description>
