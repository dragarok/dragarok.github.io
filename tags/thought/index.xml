      <description>&amp;ndash; book_author: Milan Kundera &amp;ndash; rating: 5/5

The jealousy between mistresses of Tomas: his breaking out of himself and his rules led the story here.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t we feel a curiosity why music has played such an important part of our life? Even though we dont like a certain language, we love to hear the mere music without understanding what it&amp;rsquo;s talking about, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
