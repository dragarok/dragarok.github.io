One object might contain other objects but cannot actually replace an object.&#xA;Multiple attributes are present in an object. Identity sepatate from others. Data to describe it&amp;rsquo;s current states.&#xA;Class is a blueprint of the house and house is a object. It can be used to create these objects.&#xA;Objects are defined as type: methods and attributes&#xA;Objects are the instances of a class and they are known as instantiation.&#xA;Existig classes like i/o networking strings dates arrays etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
