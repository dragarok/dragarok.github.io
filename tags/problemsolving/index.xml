      <description>Integrating image processing with machine learning consists of following steps:
Decide your project title/purpose/objectives.
Collect data, i.e images relevant to your project.
Preprocess all the collected images. Preprocessing steps may be different for different projects. It basically includes filtering, noise removal, grayscale conversion, binary image formation, morphological operation, thresholding and so on.
Divide the preprocessed images into two sets: training and tesing sets.
Extract features that you think will most probably define your data.</description>
