      <description>&amp;ndash; Topology is a branch of mathematics which deals with characterizing shapes, space and sets by their connectivity. In topology, we express relationship between two spaces through continuous maps between them.&#xA;&amp;ndash; Mathematical formulation of topology:&#xA;Let M be a set and P(M) be the set of all subsets of M (i.e. power set of M). A set O ⊆ P(M) is called a topology, if all of the following properties are satisfied: (i) O contains the null set and the set M itself.</description>
