      <description>Topology is a branch of mathematics which deals with characterizing shapes, space  and sets by their connectivity. In topology, we express relationship between two spaces through continuous maps between them.
 Mathematical formulation of topology:  Let M be a set and P(M) be the set of all subsets of M (i.e. power set of M). A set O âŠ† P(M) is called a topology, if all of the following properties are satisfied: (i) O contains the null set and the set M itself.</description>
