      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-reminiscence&#34;&gt;A Reminiscence&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../ox-hugo/school_note.jpg&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at this image, I find it funny how we change so much that we are no&#xA;longer ourselves. I believed I was this way for as long as I can remember but&#xA;alas with time: memories fade, people around you change and you no longer are&#xA;the same person that you were before.&#xA;This is the first page of my diary I made in my 9th grade.&#xA;Looking at the aim I wrote in this diary, it feels so funny and grave misfortune&#xA;that I had no idea about the storm of life that was about to burst upon me with&#xA;all it&amp;rsquo;s might. I so foolishly believed life was all about being the best in&#xA;exams. There&amp;rsquo;s a catch here though: the people I was around, the people who&#xA;wanted me to have a bright successful life always came to me and said it: maybe&#xA;thousand times or more. My teachers, my parents, my relatives and everyone that&#xA;wished well for me.&#xA;Either they didn&amp;rsquo;t know that life was so intricate and complex beyond you&#xA;passing exams and being best out of it. I believed it to be the holy grail that&#xA;would guide my life now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
