      <description>A Reminiscence Looking at this image, I find it funny how we change so much that we are no longer ourselves. I believed I was this way for as long as I can remember but alas with time: memories fade, people around you change and you no longer are the same person that you were before.

Looking at the aim I wrote in this diary, it feels so funny and grave misfortune that I had no idea about the storm of life that was about to burst upon me with all it&amp;rsquo;s might.</description>
