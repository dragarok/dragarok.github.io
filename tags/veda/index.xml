      <description>Rig Veda is the oldest existing text in any Indo-European language.  Rig Veda was composed around 1700 BC with the oldest parts as early as 2000 BC. There is still no fixed time when it was first composed. The time expressed is based on the events that are described in this book.
  Rig Veda is the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest religious text in continuous use. 4000 years of unbroken tradition is something worth venerable.</description>
