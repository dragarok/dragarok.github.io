DMT is believed to be release during dreaming, during spiritual and mystical&#xA;experiences, and during the time of death&#xA;&amp;ndash;  a lot of people who have had out-of-body experiences report a silver cord linking their astral body back to their&#xA;physical body located either in between the eyes or at the back of the head where the pineal gland would be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
