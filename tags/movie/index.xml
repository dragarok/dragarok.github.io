      <description>Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.&#xA;Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.&#xA;Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</description>
