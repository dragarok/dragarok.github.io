      <title>  Mindset for The &#34;Uncertain&#34; times

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you think about world from diverse mental models and maps, you&amp;rsquo;ve already recognized that traditional structures in this world are falling. Be it Politics, Business, Education and so on. As if a switch was pressed, and it started getting more and more random. Ray Dalio has written a book on &amp;ldquo;The Changing World Order&amp;rdquo;. With close sensitive observation, its hard not to take a note.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world is always in change without a doubt. But the important point of note is it remains relatively stable ( stale ) for decades or even centuries sometimes. Previously, money and leverage followed structure much more rigidly. Now, look at what altcoins and crypto is doing. Look at how influencer economy impacted our lives. One person is grinding their entire life saving pennies, and there&amp;rsquo;s another one who gains and loses like a gambling game. But if you look closely enough, its a form of barter we have accepted and used. So, you are a part of that gambling match whether you post your content publicly or not. Whether you know crypto or not. Big countries might adapt it, and a lot of lives change. Big countries make it illegal, and a lot of lives change too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025 Yearly Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;!!&amp;rdquo; I want to start with an exclamation. This year has been one of that year that I had been waiting for decades to happen to me. From the year 2023, it finally crossed the Tipping Point and started getting crazier.&#xA;There were parts about my identity that I really got to explore, go deep into, and really uncover myself piece by piece. Like going petal by petal in a lotus flower. 🪷&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Satya Poem: After a decade</title>
      <link>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2025/10/satya-poem-after-a-decade/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2025/10/satya-poem-after-a-decade/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The context is this: I wrote this poem as an extension of my emotions 10 years ago.&#xA;The poem&amp;rsquo;s titled &amp;ldquo;Satya&amp;rdquo; and was the first poem on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neither am I a poet, nor a storyteller. I wrote what I genuinely felt at that time. And this was close to when Gadhimai Mela was about to happen and there was a lot of news about &lt;strong&gt;Bali Pratha&lt;/strong&gt; needing to stop and so on. It triggered something that was already brewing inside me vehemently, into words. This is my commentary on my own writing after 10 years of seeking, learning, and coming home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Smiling like a madman</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First I was innocent,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I asked for an identity,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;The world pushed me down and pained me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I talked to the world about this pain,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And the world mocked me.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I felt alone in this fight,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I wanted to run away.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;But, she didn&#39;t let me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;She made me break into a thousand pieces,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;But always took great care that none was lost.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And when I gave up,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;She made me work on myself.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And That&#39;s how I recollected myself to be wholler than the whole.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;-------------------------------xx-------------------------------&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Second I was in limelight,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I asked for strength,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Then the eyes of the world fixated at me pained me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Their dreams, their expectations,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Them trying to fulfill their dreams through me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I again talked to the world about the burden of expectations,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And the world really didn&#39;t care.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I felt alone again in this fight,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I wanted to run away.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;But, she didn&#39;t let me.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;She made me take even more burden until I broke again,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Yet she took great care again that none was lost.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And when I gave up,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;She made me work on myself.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;And That&#39;s how I recollected myself to be wholler than the whole again.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;-------------------------------xx-------------------------------&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, I was now strong enough to take any burden.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I asked for truth,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;I started wandering here and there in search of truth,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;The words from thousand masters buzzed like a bomb inside my head.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;But by now, I knew the world never listened.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;So I chose a few I was hoping would listen without judgement,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Tried telling them about the never ending search,&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Yet they too didn&amp;rsquo;t get much.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dream-of-liberation-from-fear-to-truth&#34;&gt;The Dream of Liberation: From Fear to Truth&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wise ones teach that the universe was born from the desire of The One—not out of pity, not to cause pain, but from a longing to multiply and know itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the Chhandogya Upanishad (6.2.1) declares,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“sadeva somyedamagra āsīdekamevādvitīyam&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;taddhaika āhurasadevedamagra&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;āsīdekamevādvitīyaṃ tasmādasataḥ sajjāyata”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;—“Somya, before this world was manifest there was only existence, one without a second. On this subject, some maintain that before this world was manifest there was only non-existence, one without a second. Out of that non-existence, existence emerged.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 in a nutshell</title>
      <link>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2024/12/2024-in-a-nutshell/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2024/12/2024-in-a-nutshell/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started this year differently compared to years before. In the year&amp;rsquo;s end, I saw who I could become, who I was and got some glimpse into what 2024 was going to be about. Really got energized already at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2023 was speeding with insights. Its been a slow year compared to 2023 because everything was about calming down. We built a home for ourselves. I realized having a home that you design and build yourself based on how you want it to look like and make you feel, is a great blessing. Its been one wholesome journey to build my home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Love</title>
      <link>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2023/10/on-love/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2023/10/on-love/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to write some essays on basic words that are the hardest to capture because often times it&amp;rsquo;s these words that stir up conflict: love, happiness, fulfillment, peace, pain, god,  spirituality etc.&#xA;Because they are the most overused, yet least understood by our subconscious minds, our subconscious gets trippy while making sense.&#xA;I started writing this essay about six months ago.  In trying to write this essay, I started by searching for word love in my personal notes vault. It got overwhelming even after a day digesting, that I gave up the pursuit for some time. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t have any digest apart from notes and excerpts from others. I knew where to start, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t end it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When I read &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tibetan Book of Dying and Living&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, I found out that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bardo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was a Tibetan word taken into English, and has a very big significance in Tibetan.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tibetans are very clear about stages after death, re-incarnation, enlightenment on par with our clarity about daily tasks we do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The more I read about neuroscience, the more I love reading philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Sanskrit and Sanskrit Texts:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sanskrit Grammar is such an elegant topic that was written a long time ago. I have no problem with people rejecting anything, but if we have no appreciation for the roots that we gave to the world, we are losing our identity into it. Sanskrit Grammar is one of the first complete grammar of any language in the world. Very elaborate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am more intrigued by Eastern Philosophy because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand, easy because it fills gaps from our traditions, other related stories like Puranas, and folklores. Since Nepali language is derived from Sanskrit as well, I can contemplate some ideas from Sanskrit into my mind directly too. I have at least learned primitive level Sanskrit Grammar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most of the Buddhist texts were originally written in Sanskrit and Pali. Still to this day, Tibetans read both Sanskrit and Tibetan translation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In Nepal and India, we see Hinduism as this giant ball of tradition. We, as intellectuals, need to be able to separate contemporary usefulness of traditions from philosophy, and give it a fair chance without making it a mockery by comparing it with Western Philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Upanishads are the lesser known beautiful extracts of Hindu tradition that comes under &lt;strong&gt;Vedanta&lt;/strong&gt;. Upanishads are called &lt;strong&gt;Vedanta&lt;/strong&gt; [ The End of Vedas ] because it&amp;rsquo;s said that they contain all the teachings of Veda in a more succinct form. Philosophical foods of thought that have been neglected because it&amp;rsquo;s hard to make philosophy a part of tradition unlike stories ( a.k.a Puranas ). There are many Upanishads, but 108 principal ones. Among them, 9 or 11 are said to be of significant importance. They are just like a few poems long.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make Something Wonderful by Steve Jobs is a simple yet beautiful book on how Steve&amp;rsquo;s mind worked. And, it really is inspiring for someone who wants to build stuff for people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every school should teach &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Read a Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Reading is not just memorizing or marking something as complete. Reading is much more. And it depends on what you are reading. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t read everything the same way. Like Francis Bacon said, &amp;ldquo;Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s easier said than done.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Having a kindle really helps me because I can pick and drop books at any time without feeling guilty about it. I usually have around 200 books on my kindle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are curious about getting overview and some details into theory of consciousness, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Anil Seth is a great book. I loved his talks through the years, and this is a good digest of the whole field of consciousness and his theory of it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Read Psychology so you can understand your mind better. Reading Psychology + Meditating helps me clarify a lot of my confusions, and helps me accept conclusions that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like accepting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have been pretty intrigued by death for a year or two now because I see it as hindrance to my true fulfillment. How can I truly be if I am always running away from something invisible? I still have amends to make, but a lot of ideas have been still like a lake on my mind. It&amp;rsquo;s not that the waves don&amp;rsquo;t come, but they settle quickly. I hope to be in equanimity with death soon enough, so that I can truly live.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Zen is nothing more nothing less than mindfulness. There can be a thousand teachings and koans, but the essence is to simply be. The closest example of Zen that you can understand is Kung Fu Panda. Compare Master Shifu, Po, and Master Oogway; right in that comparison is answer to what Zen is. Knowing is one thing; accepting is another which you can learn from Shifu.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am really loving &lt;strong&gt;Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have any recommendations, or want certain recommendations; hit me up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My relationship with my body</title>
      <link>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2023/01/my-relationship-with-my-body/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0545</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dragarok.github.io/posts/2023/01/my-relationship-with-my-body/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all identify our bodies as &amp;ldquo;my body&amp;rdquo; and &lt;strong&gt;not me directly&lt;/strong&gt;. The whole idea of this blog post revolves around this idea. The purpose of this blog post is to establish an idea on how to build healthier lifestyle based on this concept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not like we intentionally don&amp;rsquo;t want to build healthier habits. We try to pick up exercise habits, but we are too lazy to work on it. We eat haphazardly, and without any consideration to our health. It&amp;rsquo;s a very universal problem. So, I had the same problem. On top of that, I have always been a person low in Conscientiousness, which means I used to have a hard time pushing my goals to myself if I was the only one responsible for it. Finally, I found a way that worked for me that might work for you too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
