      <description>### Author: SANGHI, ASHWIN
  loc 173 - eventually get married. Being at the right place
  loc 206 - Pretty much everything we do to make ourselves lucky or unlucky can be traced back to attitude and approach.
  loc 221 - On the other hand, the lucky group approached the task with less anxiety, greater optimism and in a far more relaxed frame of mind. They did not see the need to compete, and this relaxed attitude allowed them to observe beyond the immediate task at hand.</description>

  loc 1 - Here two sets of multiplexers select register which perform input data for ALU. A decoder selects destination register by enabling its load input. The function select in ALU determines the particular operation that to be performed
  loc 1 - For an example to perform the operation: R3  R1 + R2 1. MUX A selector (SELA): to place the content of R1 into bus A.</description>

  loc 678 - Simply put, O(log N) is the Big O way of describing an algorithm that increases one step each time the data is doubled.
  loc 1542 - Looking up a value in a hash table has an efficiency of O(1) on average, as it takes just one step.
  loc 1555 - The truth is that a hash function needs to meet only one criterion to be valid: a hash function must convert the same string to the same number every single time it’s applied.</description>

  loc 162 - we are unlikely to have a good and meaningful life unless we can overcome our insatiability.
  loc 441 - Students who knew logic could detect the fallacies committed by others and thereby prevail over them in arguments.
  loc 443 - And besides providing explanations of natural phenomena, as modern physics does, Stoic physics was concerned with what we would call theology.</description>

      <description>### Author: Meike, G. Blake
  loc 376 - Synchronization is the basic mechanism through which multiple Java threads share state in such a way that the result of the interaction is deterministic.
  loc 400 - A correct concurrent program is one that abides by the contract for maintaining an illusion.
  loc 401 - Negotiation between application programmers and hardware developers produce a language, and that language is a contract.</description>

      <description>### Author: Mew, Kyle
  loc 330 - This is not to say that code can be simply cut and pasted from one project to another but that the concepts themselves can be used over and over again in many different situations.
  loc 333 - When a developer describes a structure as say, an adapter or a facade, other developers will understand what this means and will immediately recognize the structure and purpose of the code.</description>

  loc 96 - An Android operating system, regardless of version number, is composed of five software components. They are the Linux kernel, libraries, Android runtime, application framework, and applications.

A few of the known libraries in Android are surface manager, media framework, SQLite, OpenGL, ES, FreeType, WebKit, SGL, SSL, and libc.</description>

  loc 28 - However, when the waves are radiated, they form closed loops and there are no charges to sustain their existence. This leads us to conclude that electric charges are required to excite the ﬁelds but are not needed to sustain them and may exist in their absence. This is in direct analogy with water waves
  loc 30 - interaction. With today’s advanced numerical and computational methods, and animation and visualization software and hardware, this dilemma can, to a large extent, be minimized.</description>
