      <description>I have been trying to write some essays on basic words that are the hardest to capture because often times it&amp;rsquo;s these words that stir up conflict: love, happiness, fulfillment, peace, pain, god, spirituality etc. Because they are the most overused, yet least understood by our subconscious minds, our subconscious gets trippy while making sense. I started writing this essay about six months ago. In trying to write this essay, I started by searching for word love in my personal notes vault.</description>

Alok Regmi I am a Software Engineer with Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IOE Pulchowk Campus, Nepal.
Curiosity is my prime interest. ML/AI is my primary work/passion. Currently working as ML/AI Architect. Problem Solving is my core skill. I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by anything and everything that even remotely concerns human mind. The more complex an idea is, the greater the interest.
I love to read as much as I can.</description>

      <description>We all identify our bodies as &amp;ldquo;my body&amp;rdquo; and not me directly. The whole idea of this blog post revolves around this idea. The purpose of this blog post is to establish an idea on how to build healthier lifestyle based on this concept.
It&amp;rsquo;s not like we intentionally don&amp;rsquo;t want to build healthier habits. We try to pick up exercise habits, but we are too lazy to work on it.</description>

      <description>K Means Clustering res &amp;lt;- kmeans(x, centers = num, nstart = num, iter.max = 20) res$cluster # gives the cluster number for each data point print(res) # prints cluster means, cluster, sum of squares by cluster and so on. Arguments
Centers is the number of clusters to make. Nstart is used to run algorithm multiple times to improve the odds of the best model. Iter.max is used to set the number of steps to do when creating each clusters.</description>

      <description>Aggregate by column aggregate(col_name ~ by_column_name, data = df_name, mean) We can use other functions instead of mean as well. The variable after tilde is what the aggregation is done with respect to. If by_column_name is continent, the above code will calculate the mean for all continents for given column: e.g. age or anything like that.
Nearest Neighbors library(class) knn(train = train_data, test = test_data, cl=vector_train_labels) Confusion Matrix
table(actual_classes, pred_classes) This creates a confusion matrix based on number of observations.</description>

      <description>Getting the coefficients ID: 4e16c77d-2e7f-418a-8e03-ce7200ca9d89 coef(model_var) summary(model_var) fitted.values(mod_var) # each observation fitted residuals(mod_var) \[e + \hat{y} = y \] The sum of residual and fitted value is equal to the original value.
Coefficient of determination \[R^{2}=1-\frac{S S E}{S S T}=1-\frac{\operatorname{Var}(e)}{\operatorname{Var}(y)}\] This helps to analyze between different models how good the fit is. It compares the model&amp;rsquo;s utility with respect o null model. \[ y = \hat{y} \] which always outputs the mean of the overall data whatever the input is.</description>

      <description>Practice Course Dropping levels from categorical dataset
df %&amp;gt;% filter(col_name != &amp;#34;certain_level&amp;#34;) %&amp;gt;% droplevels(df$col_name) Counts vs Proportions
prop.table(table_obj) prop.table(table_obj, number) # used to condition on some factor prop.table(table_obj, 1) # condition on rows prop.table(table_obj, 2) # condition on columns With this method, we can have marginal distributions for ourselves.
Numerical Data
Note on the variability of the distribution and mean of the distribution when looking at numerical data representations.
