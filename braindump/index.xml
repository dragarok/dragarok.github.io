Hugo blogging   Liked themes:
 Meme theme Harbor Cortex &amp;ndash;JethroKuan Hello friend ng rhazdon Beautiful Hugo   Blogging org mode Font    Font: Source Code Pro : big size : Looks amazing: Is in google fonts as well
//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Slab:700,300,400|Source+Code+Pro:500 //maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css
    Normalize css : I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it does but looks pretty cool with all these stars on github.</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; link: Beyond Higgs: The Wild Frontier of Particle Physics - YouTube - Brave
What are these people looking for?  Supersymmetry  Mathematical idea: Not still experimentally verified. Pencil standing on it&amp;rsquo;s tip Analogy: Though people found the Higgs out there, there is still no understanding of how the higgs is standing in the standard model. Physicists are looking for the support for the pencil if it is being held by a string or being held by hand.</description>

      <description>What Is Google Dorks? It is basically an advanced google search!
I have included four types of google dorks in this collection: Google dorks for SQL injection, Google dorks for Local File Inclusion, Google dorks For open CCTV cams and Google dorks for sensitive information.
Copy and paste the below google dorks on the search engine and have fun!

      <description>Algorithms Basic rules of complexity definition for removing terms:
 Multiplicative constants can be omitted: 14n2 becomes n2. n^a dominates n^b if a &amp;gt; b: for instance, n^2 dominates n. Any exponential dominates any polynomial: 3^n dominates n^5 (it even dominates 2^n). Likewise, any polynomial dominates any logarithm: n dominates (log n)^3. This also means, for example, that n^2 dominates n* log n.  Techniques to think of counter examples:</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; tags: Graph Convolutions
Basics Spectral Graph Convolutional Network:  GSP is the key to generalizing convolutions, allowing us to build functions that can take into account both the overall structure of the graph and the individual properties of the graph’s components. It is the graph fourier transform that allows one to introduce the notion of a “bandwidth” or “smoothness” to a graph In GCNs, node features and attributes are represented by “signals”.</description>

      <description>Graph Conv &amp;ndash; What is inductive bias ? &amp;ndash; Inductive bias of a learning algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs given inputs that it has not encountered. &amp;ndash; Neural Networks tend to discard the features that have very less significance in task at hand. &amp;ndash; Similary, GNNs have bias: By structuring the data in a way that prioritizes certain patterns, we can improve model performance, even if the data is the same.</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; tags: Graph Signal Processing
Intro &amp;ndash; The kernel is defined in Fourier space and graph Fourier transforms are notoriously expensive to compute. &amp;ndash; O(N²) operation for a graph with N nodes: the multiplication operation for i/p nodes and eigenvec of graph&amp;rsquo;s laplacian. &amp;ndash; Thus as a solution to the computational complexity introduced by it, Monte Carlo (biased random sampling method) approaches to consistently estimate the integrals, which allowed for batch training, reducing the overall training time.</description>

MoNets: &amp;ndash; Base of research such as Spline CNNs, Geodesic, Anisotropic CNNs etc. &amp;ndash; Contributions: &amp;ndash; A generalization of various Graph Learning approaches, unifying spatial and spectral approaches &amp;ndash; A new approach using parametric kernels, pseudo-coordinates, integrated with existing models (Anistropic CNN, Geodesic CNN,) &amp;ndash; A series of experiments performed on different benchmark manifolds, graphs, and networks &amp;ndash; MoNet’s generalization first considers variable x as a point in the manifold or node in a graph depending on the application, task, and input.</description>
