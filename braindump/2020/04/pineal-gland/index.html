                <p>Pineal eye</p>
<p>Why the eye?
&ndash; Retinal tissue in the inner lining and wired to the visual cortex
&ndash; vitreous fluid in it like an eye does.
&ndash;  the pineal gland is also thought to secrete a chemical known as DMT, which has
the nickname of “The Spirit Molecule”. DMT is believed to be release during dreaming, during spiritual and mystical
experiences, and during the time of death
&ndash;  a lot of people who have had out-of-body experiences report a silver cord linking their astral body back to their
physical body located either in between the eyes or at the back of the head where the pineal gland would be.</p>
<p>Detoxing the idea:
&ndash; Reduce stress.  Cortisol and Adrenaline, as well as other hormones that are created by the adrenal
glands when you are stressed can interfere with melatonin and serotonin, the sister hormones to
DMT, or the pineal elixir that helps us wake up. Interestingly, we make more melatonin when we
are in complete darkness. This is what allows the ‘inner’ light to shine more brightly. While you can
sleep for three days straight, this is hard to do without some kind of sleeping pill. The ancient yogis
and shamans would sit in caves in meditation in order to induce higher levels of melatonin, and
thus awaken their pineal glands
&ndash; Raw cocoa
&ndash; Neem herb</p>
<p>CIcardian clock : Genes and protiens:
&ndash; In individual cells, we saw
that p75NTR production was controlled by Clock and Bmal1, which bind directly to the
gene that codes for the p75NTR and start production of the protein
&ndash;  It is now known that
the molecular circadian clock can function within a single cell; i.e., it is cell-autonomous.
&ndash; the information of the time of the day as relayed by the eyes travels to the clock in the brain, and,
through that, clocks in the rest of the body may be synchronised.
&ndash; The SCN takes the information on the lengths of the day and night from the retina, interprets it, and passes it
on to the pineal gland, a tiny structure shaped like a pine cone and located on theepithalamus. In response, the
pineal secretes the hormonemelatonin. Secretion of melatonin peaks at night and ebbs during the day and its
presence provides information about night-length.
&ndash; SCN is the centre for maintaining the body clock as well</p>
