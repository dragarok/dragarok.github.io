                <p>C02 dominated atmosphere billions of years ago
Global magnetic field shutdown 4.2 billlion of years ago
The atmospheric CO2 has been out of the solar system which may not be possible to bring it back
 Methane is suspected to be stable in the Martian atmosphere for only about 300 years, so whatever is generating this gas did so recently. 
volcanic activity
The planet&rsquo;s atmospheric pressure is too low, at about 1/100th of Earth&rsquo;s, for liquid water to last on the surface.
Viking had detected organic molecules such as methyl chloride and dichloromethane.
However, these compounds were dismissed as terrestrial contamination — namely, cleaning fluids used to prepare the spacecraft when it was still on Earth.</p>
<p>One would have to deal with the rigors of travel — issues of food, water and oxygen, the deleterious effects of microgravity, potential hazards such as fire and radiation and the fact that any such astronauts would be millions of miles away from help and confined together for years at a time.
The mars , are following the scientifc discoveries which if achieved , they will open new worlds to the minds and conception of the present and future generations.No one yet expects to make wealth by going to the Mars but whoever first lands on it , has the right to claim to have colonialized it.
How do you wish to find parity in a place where investors invested billions of dollars: even if they terraform mars this would be against human  ethics it will create a divide and people who cannot accommodate people in earth wont take them to mars in a certain reasonable conclusion.</p>
<p>Comparing the planet to earth:</p>
<p>The atmosphere is very thin, less than one one-hundredth that of Earth, and composed primarily of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p> the mean annual surface temperature being approximately -50°C at the equator and close to -130°C at the poles.
wind speeds up to 25 meters/sec were recorded by the Viking landers,
Despite giant dust storms, however, the wind clearly has not been very efficient in eroding the surface, because so much old terrain survives. Most of the wind&rsquo;s action probably involves reworking previously eroded debris</p>
<p> calderas, lava flows, and lava channels are also many times larger than their terrestrial counterparts. except that those on Mars are many times larger. 
Smaller in size but more prominent volcanoes
 Because of the jumbled nature of the surface, this terrain has been termed chaotic.
Thick sequences of layered deposits of unknown origin are found at both poles. They lie unconformably on the terrain and appear to be very young compared with most other features on the planet. The deposits possibly are accumulations of windblown debris mixed with condensed volatiles like water</p>
<p>The geologic histories of Mars and Earth are quite different, partly because of the internal dynamics of the planets and partly because of the differing effects of the atmospheres and oceans.
present configuration of the Earth&rsquo;s surface is thus a partial record of the motion of different plates with respect to one another.
 </p>
<p>Mars displays little, if any, evidence of plate motion. The crust appears very stable
 On Earth, surface materials are recycled at a relatively rapid rate by erosional processes and subduction.
Crustal stability may also be the cause of the large size of the Martian volcanoes. On Earth, volcanoes are limited in size because plate motion usually carries them away from the magma source. On Mars, however, a volcano remains over its source and can continue to grow as long as magma is available.
100000-200000$ for a ticket to mars as elon musk said . these are the people who made space fights affordable and they say so. It’s a clear way it is going to create violence around the planet as well as leaving the poorer people to die when they get to live in a new planet they have well created to live in for.</p>
<p>understandably reluctant to stump up cash for ventures where a failure of technology could take months to rectify, cost many millions of dollars, or even human lives.</p>
<p>Many new aerospace technologies are highly capital- and labour-intensive, have long development timelines, serve markets that are nascent (if they exist at all) and rely on launch systems that can be slow, expensive and unreliable.</p>
<p>With the recent successes of Mr Musk’s SpaceX, however, things are finally starting to change.</p>
<p>Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution(MAVEN)</p>
<p>Traditional terraforming methods like giant mirrors to create greenhouse effect on mars
Getting [to another star] is half the battle, but you also have to give thought to what you do once you get there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One of the objectives of travelling to another star … is colonization. It&rsquo;s unlikely that once we get to an alien star system, we&rsquo;ll find a world that we can move into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One team sees the quest to replicate the biosphere of Earth on other planets as a moral imperative, an inevitable destiny, or both.</p>
<p> religious conflicts. Disagreements rooted in faith, belief and longing. What you won&rsquo;t hear, usually, is good science. Not often sound engineering tips</p>
<p> The asteroids are much easier to work with. Earth&rsquo;s Moon is closer, better known and sports a more fun-friendly gravity fiel
uropa, and (likely) other moons of the gas giants, may have lots more liquid water and could harbor more complex life. 
notion &ndash; strangely, embraced by both ultra-liberal tree huggers and rabid reactionary exploiters</p>
<p>But why would it be that Earth can do that, while Mars seems to have &ldquo;areo-formed&rdquo; itself from a warm wet world to a cold, dry barren wasteland?
We are very far from being able to control &ndash; or even fully understand &ndash; the climate of our own planet. And I think that changing the climate of an entire planet in an intended direction, getting an intended outcome and betting people&rsquo;s lives on that outcome strikes me as a chancy proposition for the foreseeable future. It sounds like a tough thing to do
I think we would be ethically on good grounds to support it, to encourage it to flourish into a global scale biota like we have on Earth, especially if it was on the verge of extinction which it could well be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good news is that there aren&rsquo;t Martians, I&rsquo;m pretty sure. But we have to be a lot more sure before we go starting to set up our strip malls and sports stadiums.&rdquo;</p>
<p> By so doing, we will show the divine nature of the human species and, therefore, the precious nature of every member of it. No one will be able to look at a terraformed Mars and not be prouder to be human</p>
<p>Almost a century ago, Tsiolkovsky&rsquo;s stunning intuition showed that long before you get to the level of engineering required to transform whole worlds, you already have everything you need to prosper in space without such worlds! And there are very good reasons not to automatically gravitate to planets
you evolved on a planet does not necessitate that you continue to live on one. : planetary chauvinism</p>
<p>And you, or your teleoperated robot, can work your way around most any asteroid with your fingertips.</p>
<p>is the living embodiment of &ldquo;disruptive technology.&rdquo; If we go (and I say we must) we will change the Solar System and it will change us.
But at the end of the night &ndash; and particularly the next morning when it comes time to approach the bankers and the venture capitalists &ndash; let&rsquo;s do what works.
launch ourselves into a Hydrogen/Oxygen economy, 
lots of cheap, free-floating, scalable, designer settlements in interesting, useful orbits. </p>
