<p>10.The Perks of Being Wallflower
The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming-of-age epistolary novel by American writer Stephen Chbosky.
Set in the early 1990s, the novel follows Charlie, an introverted teenager,
through his freshman year of high school in a Pittsburgh suburb.
The novel details Charlies unconventional style of thinking as he navigates between the worlds of adolescence and adulthood, and attempts to deal with poignant questions spurred by his interactions with both his friends and family.</p>
<p>This haunting novel about the dilemma of passivity vs. passion marks the stunning debut of a provocative new voice in contemporary fiction. This is the story of what it&rsquo;s like to grow up in high school. More intimate than a diary, Charlie&rsquo;s letters are singular and unique, hilarious and devastating. We may not know where he lives. We may not know to whom he is writing. All we know is the world he shares. Caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it puts him on a strange course through uncharted territory. The world of first dates and mixed tapes, family dramas and new friends. The world of sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, when all one requires is that the perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite.</p>
<p>Best Quotes:</p>
<p>We accept the love we think we deserve. </p>
<p>Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn&rsquo;t stop for anybody. </p>
<p>And in that moment, I swear we were infinite. </p>
<p>So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out how that could be. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Great Gatsby
On number nine our choice is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald The Great Gatsby. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession with the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald&rsquo;s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.</p>
<p>Best Quotes:
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I&rsquo;ve been turning over in my mind ever since.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;just remember that all the people in this world haven&rsquo;t had the advantages that you&rsquo;ve had. </p>
<p>I hope she&rsquo;ll be a fool &ndash; that&rsquo;s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.</p>
<p>And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. </p>
<p>I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life. </p>
<p>8.The Fault In Our Stars
The Fault in Our Stars, published in January 2012, is the sixth novel by author John Green.The story is narrated by Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old girl with thyroid cancer that has affected her lungs. Hazel is forced by her parents to attend a support group where she subsequently meets and falls in love with 17-year-old Augustus Waters, an ex-basketball player and amputee. The title is inspired by Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare&rsquo;s play Julius Caesar, in which the nobleman Cassius says to Brutus: &ldquo;The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings.&rdquo;
Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel&rsquo;s story is about to be completely rewritten.</p>
<p>Insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw, The Fault in Our Stars is award-winning author John Green&rsquo;s most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet, brilliantly exploring the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.</p>
<p>Best Quotes:</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to choose if you get hurt in this world&hellip;but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. </p>
<p>There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There&rsquo;s .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I&rsquo;m likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I&rsquo;m grateful. </p>
<p>Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. </p>
<p>My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations. </p>
<p>As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once. </p>
<ol>
<li>To Kill a Mockingbird
To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator&rsquo;s father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. Historian, J Crespino explains, &ldquo;In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.&rdquo; It has now become a classic of modern American literature. </li>
</ol>
<p>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience is our number seventh in selection. This novel went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.</p>
<p>Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</p>
<p>Best Quotes:</p>
<p>You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view&hellip; Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. </p>
<p>I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It&rsquo;s when you know you&rsquo;re licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.</p>
<p>Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing. </p>
<p>People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for. </p>
<ol>
<li>The Old Man And the Sea
Our number Sixth selection is none other than The Old Man and the Sea which has proved itself to be one of the enduring works of American fiction. It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal: a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Using the simple, powerful language of a fable, Hemingway takes the timeless themes of courage in the face of defeat and personal triumph won from loss and transforms them into a magnificent twentieth-century classic.  The short novel was written by the American author in 1951 in Cuba, and published in 1952. The last major work of fiction by Hemingway that was published during his lifetime. One of his most famous works.In 1953, The Old Man and the Sea was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and it was cited by the Nobel Committee as contributing to their awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Hemingway in 1954.</li>
</ol>
<p>Best Quotes</p>
<p>Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. </p>
<p>Let him think that I am more man than I am and I will be so.</p>
<p>But man is not made for defeat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A man can be destroyed but not defeated. </p>
<p>Now is no time to think of what you do not have.
Think of what you can do with that there is</p>
<p>He always thought of the sea as &rsquo;la mar&rsquo; which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as &rsquo;el mar&rsquo; which is masculine.They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought. </p>
<p>5.The Little Prince
Le Petit Prince, first published in April 1943, is a novella, the most famous work of French aristocrat, writer, poet, and pioneering aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The novella has been voted the best book of the 20th century in France. Though ostensibly styled as a children&rsquo;s book, The Little Prince makes several observations about life and human nature. The fox&rsquo;s messages are arguably the book&rsquo;s most famous quotations because they deal with human relationships.
Moral allegory and spiritual autobiography, The Little Prince is the most translated book in the French language. With a timeless charm it tells the story of a little boy who leaves the safety of his own tiny planet to travel the universe, learning the vagaries of adult behaviour through a series of extraordinary encounters. His personal odyssey culminates in a voyage to Earth and further adventures.</p>
<p>Best Quotes:</p>
<p>And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.</p>
<p>I am looking for friends. What does that mean &ndash; tame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an act too often neglected,&rdquo; said the fox. &ldquo;It means to establish ties.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;To establish ties?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; said the fox. &ldquo;To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world&hellip;. </p>
<p>You - you alone will have the stars as no one else has them&hellip;In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night&hellip;You - only you - will have stars that can laugh. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re beautiful, but you&rsquo;re empty&hellip;One couldn&rsquo;t die for you. Of course, an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you. But my rose, all on her own, is more important than all of you together, since she&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve watered. Since she&rsquo;s the one I put under glass, since she&rsquo;s the one I sheltered behind the screen. Since she&rsquo;s the one for whom I killed the caterpillars (except the two or three butterflies). Since she&rsquo;s the one I listened to when she complained, or when she boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing at all. Since she&rsquo;s my rose. </p>
<p>What makes the desert beautiful,&rsquo; said the little prince, &lsquo;is that somewhere it hides a well&hellip;
