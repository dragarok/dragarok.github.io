            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Scalability of web request handling:</p>
<p>That leads to the first golden rule for scalability: every server contains exactly the same codebase and does not store any user-related data, like sessions or profile pictures, on local disc or memory.</p>
<p>Sessions need to be stored in a centralized data store which is accessible to all your application servers. It can be an external database or an external persistent cache, like Redis.</p>
<p>After “outsourcing” your sessions and serving the same codebase from all your servers, you can now create an image file from one of these servers (AWS calls this AMI - Amazon Machine Image.)</p>
<p>Scalability of caches:</p>
<p>Always try to use cache such as Redis</p>
<p>The cache is good as long as you can make keys properly that you would not need even a database</p>
<p>Memcache can be used to cache direct; but more efficient approach would be redis.</p>
<p>Caches are difficult when you cache the result of query; each time table&rsquo;s element changes, the cached element has to be dropped.</p>
<p>Instead, better to use cache objects</p>
<p>Scalability of asynchronism:</p>
<p>Just imagine the scalability of your website if the script would upload these pre-rendered HTML pages to AWS S3 or Cloudfront or another Content Delivery Network!</p>
<p>Your website would be super responsive and could handle millions of visitors per hour!</p>
<p>RabbitMQ is one of many systems which help to implement async processing. You could also use ActiveMQ or a simple Redis list.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to have a queue of tasks or jobs that a worker can process.</p>
<p>Scalability for database:</p>
<p>means to denormalize right from the beginning and include no more Joins in any database query</p>
<p>Joins will now need to be done in your application code.</p>
<p>Some ideas of objects to cache:</p>
<p>user sessions (never use the database!)
fully rendered blog articles
activity streams
user&lt;-&gt;friend relationships</p>
<p>Generally, you should aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency.</p>
<p>Another way to look at performance vs scalability:</p>
<p>If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user.
If you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.</p>
<p>In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:</p>
<p>Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
Availability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
Partition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures</p>
<p>CP - consistency and partition tolerance
Waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error. CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.</p>
<p>AP - availability and partition tolerance
Responses return the most recent version of the data available on a node, which might not be the latest. Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.</p>
<p>AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for eventual consistency or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.</p>
<p>Consistency Issues:</p>
<p>Weak Consistency:
After a write, reads may or may not see it. A best effort approach is taken.</p>
<p>Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games</p>
<p>For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.</p>
<p>Strong Consistency:</p>
<p>After a write, reads will see it. Data is replicated synchronously.</p>
<p>Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.</p>
<p>Eventual Consistency</p>
<p>After a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds). Data is replicated asynchronously.</p>
<p>DNS and email</p>
<p>There are two main patterns to support high availability: fail-over and replication.</p>
<p>Fail Over</p>
<p>Active Passive</p>
<p>Heartbeat from passive to active; if active fails -&gt; passive takes on ip of previously active one</p>
<p>Master slave failover</p>
<p>Depends whether the passive one needs to hot boot or cold boot to resume the processes.</p>
<p>Active Active</p>
<p>In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.</p>
<p>If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers.</p>
<p>If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.</p>
<p>&ndash; More hardware and complex</p>
<p>&ndash; Potential loss of data if active fails before replicating the data to passive node.</p>
<p>Replication</p>
<p>Describing Availability:</p>
<p>Availability is often quantified by uptime (or downtime) as a percentage of time the service is available</p>
<p>99.9 % will have 8h downtime per year whereas 99.99% will have 52 mins downtime in a year(8.6s a day)</p>
<p>DNS:</p>
<p>DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the TTL</p>
<p>NS record (name server) - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.
MX record (mail exchange) - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.
A record (address) - Points a name to an IP address.
CNAME (canonical) - Points a name to another name or CNAME (example.com to <a href="https://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>) or to an A record.</p>
<p>Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:</p>
<p>Weighted round robin
Prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance
Balance between varying cluster sizes
A/B testing
Latency-based
Geolocation-based</p>
<p>CDNs:</p>
<p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user.</p>
<p>The site&rsquo;s DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.</p>
<p>Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:</p>
<p>Users receive content at data centers close to them
Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills</p>
<p>Push CDNs:</p>
<p>Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server.</p>
<p>You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN.</p>
<p>Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.</p>
<p>Pull CDNs:</p>
<p>Pull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content</p>
<p>This results in a slower request until the content is cached on the CDN.</p>
<p>A time-to-live (TTL) determines how long content is cached.</p>
<p>Sites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.</p>
<p>&ndash; CDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN.</p>
<p>&ndash; Costly</p>
<p>&ndash; Stale content if update happens before TTL</p>
<p>Load Balancer:</p>
<p>Pick a worker to forward the request. The worker will be chosen based on different types of algorithms.</p>
<p>Load balancers are effective at:</p>
<p>Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers</p>
<p>Preventing overloading resources</p>
<p>Helping eliminate single points of failure</p>
<p>Can be implemented using hardware or software using a proxy known as HAProxy.</p>
<p>Additional benefits include:</p>
<p>SSL termination</p>
<p>encryption decryption from load balancer so ease for actual workers</p>
<p>Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server</p>
<p>Session persistence</p>
<p>Issue cookies and route a specific client&rsquo;s requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions</p>
<p>Load balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:</p>
<p>Random
Least loaded
Session/cookies
Round robin or weighted round robin
Layer 4
Layer 7</p>
<p>Layer 4 and 7 means the layers of Network protocol standards</p>
<p>Layer 4:</p>
<p>load balancers look at info at the transport layer to decide how to distribute requests.</p>
<p>Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet.</p>
<p>Performs NAT</p>
<p>Layer 7:</p>
<p>Layer 7 load balancers look at the application layer to decide how to distribute requests.</p>
<p>terminates network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server.</p>
<p>can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.</p>
<p>At the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.</p>
<p>&ndash; The load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly.</p>
<p>&ndash; increased complexity</p>
<p>&ndash; A single load balancer is a single point of failure, configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity.</p>
<p>Horizontal Scaling:</p>
<p>Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability
than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called Vertical Scaling.</p>
<p>Scaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers:
Servers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures</p>
<p>Sessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a database (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent cache (Redis, Memcached)</p>
<p>Downstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out</p>
<p>Reverse Proxy:</p>
<p>web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public.</p>
<p>Secure, Scalability and Flexibility, SSL termination, Compression, Caching, Static content serve</p>
<p>Load balancer vs reverse proxy:</p>
<p>Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers. Often, load balancers route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.</p>
<p>Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server</p>
<p>Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.</p>
<p>Separating out the web layer from the application layer (also known as platform layer) allows you to scale and configure both layers independently.</p>
<p>Adding a new API results in adding application servers without necessarily adding additional web servers.</p>
<p>Microservices : Each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal.</p>
<p>Service Discovery</p>
<p>Systems such as Consul, Etcd, and Zookeeper can help services find each other by keeping track of registered names, addresses, and ports.</p>
<p>Health checks help verify service integrity and are often done using an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>Both Consul and Etcd have a built in key-value store that can be useful for storing config values and other shared data.</p>
<p>Functional Partitioning:</p>
<p>Federation (or functional partitioning) splits up databases by function.</p>
<p>For example, instead of a single, monolithic database, you could have three databases: forums, users, and products,
resulting in less read and write traffic to each database and therefore less replication lag</p>
<p>&ndash;  not effective if your schema requires huge functions or tables.</p>
<p>&ndash; need to update your application logic to determine which database to read and write.</p>
<p>&ndash; Joining data from two databases is more complex with a server link.</p>
<p>Sharding:</p>
<p>Sharding distributes data across different databases such that each database can only manage a subset of the data</p>
<p>sharding results in less read and write traffic, less replication, and more cache hits.</p>
<p>If one shard goes down, the other shards are still operational, although you&rsquo;ll want to add some form of replication to avoid data loss.</p>
<p>Common ways to shard a table of users is either through the user&rsquo;s last name initial or the user&rsquo;s geographic location.</p>
<p>&ndash; update your application logic to work with shards,</p>
<p>&ndash;set of power users on a shard could result in increased load to that shard compared to others</p>
<p>Denormalization:</p>
<p>Increase performance at the cost of additional write in the database</p>
<p>Constraints to help different parts of db to sync; hard.</p>
<p>SQL Tuning:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to benchmark and profile to simulate and uncover bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Benchmark - Simulate high-load situations with tools such as ab.</p>
<p>Profile - Enable tools such as the slow query log to help track performance issues.</p>
<p>Good things to do:</p>
<p>CHAR instead of VARCHAR for fixed-length fields</p>
<p>TEXT for large blocks of text such as blog posts</p>
<p>INT for larger numbers up to 2^32 or 4 billion</p>
<p>DECIMAL for currency to avoid floating point representation errors.</p>
<p>Avoid storing large BLOBS, store the location of where to get the object instead.</p>
<p>Set the NOT NULL constraint where applicable to improve search performance.</p>
<p>Use good indices.</p>
<p>Avoid expensive joins: i.e. denormalize where needed</p>
<p>NosQL:</p>
<p>Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code.</p>
<p>Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions and favor eventual consistency.</p>
<p>BASE chooses availability over consistency.</p>
<p>Basically available - the system guarantees availability.</p>
<p>Soft state - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.</p>
<p>Eventual consistency - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn&rsquo;t receive input during that period.</p>
<p>Key Value Stores:</p>
<p>Key-value stores provide high performance and are often used for simple data models or for rapidly-changing data, such as an in-memory cache layer</p>
<p>Document Value stores:</p>
<p>Couch-db , mongo-db etc store all data as documents.</p>
<p>JSON, XML type storage of the data</p>
<p>Wide column store:</p>
<p>A wide column store&rsquo;s basic unit of data is a column (name/value pair)</p>
<p>Column can be grouped in column families</p>
<p>Super column families further group column families.</p>
<p>BigTable, Cassandra etc. are examples of such db.</p>
<p>Graph Database:
Node is a record</p>
<p>Use to store data having many to many relationships</p>
<p>Neo4j , FlockDB etc.</p>
<p>SQL vs NoSQL:
Temporary store: NO
Non relational data: no
Store huge data: NO
Strict schema: S</p>
<p>Caching:
CDN
Web server -&gt; Reverse proxies, Varnish e.g.
Database -&gt; to boost db performance
Client -&gt; in browser, server side or distinct cache layer
Application -&gt; Memcache , Redis</p>
<p>Database query cache issues: Hard to delete cached result with complex query, need to delete on small change
Object level cache: Cache of user session , fully rendered web pages, activity streams, user graph data</p>
<p>Cache-aside is also referred to as lazy loading. Only requested data is cached, which avoids filling up the cache with data that isn&rsquo;t requested.</p>
<p>Issues of cache aside: Cache miss involves three steps to fetch data; data can become stale: solved by
write through or TTL.</p>
<p>Refresh-ahead can result in reduced latency vs read-through if the cache can accurately predict which items are likely to be needed in the future.</p>
<p>Asynchronism:</p>
<p>Message queues:
Message queues receive, hold, and deliver messages.</p>
<p>An application publishes a job to the queue, then notifies the user of job status.</p>
<p>A worker picks up the job from the queue, processes it, then signals the job is complete</p>
<p>For example, if posting a tweet, the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline, but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers.</p>
<p>Redis is a simple msg broker, RabbitMQ, AmazonSQS are some examples.</p>
<p>Task  Queues:</p>
<p>Receive task and related data , runs them and delivers results.</p>
<p>e.g. Celery python support and scheduling</p>
<p>Back pressure:</p>
<p>Once queues fill up client gets 503.</p>
<p>HTTP Requests:
GET: reads resource ; cacheable</p>
<p>PUT: creates or replaces a resource; not cacheable</p>
<p>PATCH: partailly update resouce; cacheable if response contains freshness info</p>
<p>DELETE, POST</p>
<p>RPC:</p>
<p>a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server</p>
<p>Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls</p>
<p>e.g. Protobuf, Thrift , Avro</p>
<p>Consists of :
Client program : params pushed to stack like local procedure call
Client stub procedure: packs procedure id and args into request msg
Client Comm module: os sends msg from client to server
Server comm module
Server stub procedure : calls server procedure matching procedure id and passes given args</p>
<p>RPC is focused on exposing behaviors.</p>
<p>RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.</p>
<p>&ndash; RPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.</p>
<p>&ndash; A new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.</p>
<p>REST: Representational State transfer</p>
<p>The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources.</p>
<p>All communication must be stateless and cacheable.</p>
<p>Qualities of restful instance:</p>
<p>identify resources: use same uri regardless of action</p>
<p>verbs</p>
<p>status response in http</p>
<p>must be fully accessible in a browser</p>
<p>REST is focused on exposing data</p>
<p>Great for horizontal scaling and partitioning</p>
<p>Security:</p>
<p>Principle of least privilege</p>
<p>Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection</p>
<p>1 TB means 1 trillion, 1GB means 1 billion, 1MB means one millions</p>
<p>Latency comparison:</p>
<p>L1 cache: 0.5ns
L2 cache: 7ns
Mutex lock/unlock: 25ns
Main mem reference: 100 ns
Send 1kb over 1GBps network: 10us
SSD read speed: 1Gb/sec around; read 1mb from ssd: 1ms
Disk seek: 10ms
read 1mb from disk: 30ms
read 1mb from 1gbps: 10ms</p>
