<p>In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a
weighing machine. &ndash; Warren Buffett. This means fools will often have bad
companies go high on the market on shorter runs but eventually the companies
that have true value will rise later.</p>
<p>Price is what you pay, value is what you get. &ndash; Warren Buffett. The value of a
company at a given time is fixed, the price for the stocks can either be high or
low. No matter what price you pay for stock, it&rsquo;s the same value you get.</p>
<p>If you buy $1 worth of growing business in less than $1, you will make money in
the long run.</p>
<h3 id="value-of-a-company">Value of a company</h3>
<p>If company has to rely on operations alone to grow and pay its bills, it&rsquo;s the
intrinsic value of the company.
The critical investment factor is determining the intrinsic value of a business
and paying a fair or bargain price. &ndash; Warren Buffett</p>
<p><strong>Value = Shareholder equity + Discounted value of cash that can be taken out</strong></p>
<p><em>Shareholder Equity</em> is a company’s net worth. It is essentially the sum of money
investors would be entitled to if the company stopped operations, sold off all
of its assets, paid off its debts, and distributed cash to owners. Shareholder
Equity is easily found on any balance sheet of any company.</p>
<p><em>Intrinsic value</em> can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash
that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.</p>
<p>The <em>owner earnings calculation</em> tells us whether or not our business could
survive, and thrive, on its operations alone, or if it constantly needs to find
alternative sources of cash (selling stock, taking on debt, etc) to grow.</p>
<p><em>Reported Earnings</em> (the earnings Wall Street adores) plus <em>Non-Cash Charges</em> (tax
write-offs that did not actually require cash) minus <em>Capital Expenditures</em> (the
cash the business must spend to keep product pumping off the assembly line, so
to speak).</p>
<p>Why, then, are “cash flow” numbers so popular today? In answer, we confess our
cynicism: we believe these numbers are frequently used by marketers of
businesses and securities in attempts to justify the unjustifiable (and thereby
to sell what should be the unsalable)…though dentists correctly claim that if
you ignore your teeth they’ll go away, the same is not true for [capital
expenditures]. &ndash; Warren Buffett
For that use J&amp;J evaluation.</p>
<p>What are you willing to pay today to end up with $50 next year? Would you pay
$50? $45? $20? Your answer to that is the basis for the next step in valuing a
business.</p>
<p><strong>Value</strong>
The total value of something is what someone is willing to pay for it minus all
the effort you have done to obtain it. If the effort alone costs you more than
what money someone is willing to pay for it, then it has negative value.</p>
<h3 id="stock-valuation-concepts">Stock Valuation Concepts</h3>
<p>Stock Valuation = Past and current numbers + Future Narrative</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stock Valuation is an art</strong>. You can have the same resources but the overall
output that can come with similar resources is qualitative side of stock
valuation.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Valuation is a range not an absolute.</strong> Possible upside and downside of
the company can be valuated using different scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Benjamin Graham&rsquo;s Formula</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>\begin{equation}V *=E P S \times(8.5+2 g)\end{equation}</p>
<h2 id="share-evaluation-metrics">Share Evaluation Metrics</h2>
<h3 id="return-on-investment">Return on Investment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Money company has made or lost on an investment.</li>
<li>You buy something for $10 and sold it later for $20, it&rsquo;s 100% ROI.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s the returns that you get from investment divided by your cost of
investment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="free-cash-flow">Free Cash Flow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cash produced by the company minus it&rsquo;s expenditures.</li>
<li>Capital left after company pays for operating expenses and capital expenditures.</li>
<li>Shows if company is able to run smoothly and also to pay dividends to shareholders.</li>
<li>Company can have increasing FCF either due to reduced operating costs or more
sales growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="return-on-equity">Return on Equity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measures a corporation&rsquo;s profitability.</li>
<li>Profit divided by amount of equity or total amount of money invested in the
company.</li>
<li>Higher ROE means company is more efficient and are able to make more money
with less investment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="price-to-earnings-ratio">Price to Earnings ratio</h3>
<ul>
<li>Know whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued.</li>
<li>High P/E ratio means stock&rsquo;s price is expensive related to it&rsquo;s earnings and
thus overvalued.</li>
<li>By finding stocks with less P/E values, for same level of financial
performance you get more stocks.</li>
<li>The only downside is that it uses past earnings as  a measure for prediction
of future returns which might not always be the case. Also it doesn&rsquo;t take
into account the growth of the earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Important for comparing companies within the same industry</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="price-to-book-ratio">Price to Book ratio</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ratio of net values [ Assets - Liabilities ] to it&rsquo;s market capitalization.</li>
<li>Also the ratio of stock&rsquo;s share price to the book value per share (BVPS).</li>
<li>Market price is price investors are willing to pay for the company&rsquo;s stock
while book value is a conservative measure derived from company&rsquo;s net value.</li>
<li>P/B ratio of 0.95, 1 or 1.1 means the stock is nearly at book value. So, it is
useful when the number differs from 1.</li>
<li>A ratio of 0.5 would mean the stock price is at 50% of company&rsquo;s book value:
so good opportunity for investment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debt-to-equity-ratio">Debt to Equity ratio</h3>
<ul>
<li>To know how a company finances it&rsquo;s assets.</li>
<li>A low debt-to-equity ratio means the company uses a lower amount of debt for
financing versus shareholder equity.</li>
<li>Too much debt can pose a risk to company if they don&rsquo;t have enough cash flow
to meet their obligations.</li>
<li>A high D/E doesn&rsquo;t mean a company is run poorly. It varies with industry type.</li>
<li>Some industries with a lot of fixed assets, such as the auto and construction
industries, typically have higher ratios than companies in other industries.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="price-earnings-to-growth-ratio">Price Earnings to Growth Ratio</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modified version of P/E to take growth into account.</li>
<li>P/E ratio divided by earnings growth.</li>
<li>PEG &lt; 1 means stock&rsquo;s undervalued since price is low compared to company&rsquo;s
expected earnings growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="payout-ratio">Payout ratio</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be an important metric if there&rsquo;s a question about the dividend&rsquo;s truth.</li>
<li>Annual dividend rate divided by earnings.</li>
<li>Closer a payout ratio is to 100% or higher, the less stable the future
dividend could be.</li>
<li>Payout ratios of 60% or less with a history of increasing the dividend can be
seen as good metrics to judge a company.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="earnings-per-share">Earnings Per Share</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take the profit, subtract the dividends and divide by the number of shares.</li>
<li>Without expenses, this information doesn&rsquo;t clarify the whole picture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compound-annual-growth-rate">Compound Annual Growth Rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measures annual growth rate of an investment.</li>
<li>Rather than year to year, it&rsquo;s generally useful to take average over time to
time rather than year by year.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="beta">Beta</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measurement of how reactive a stock is compared to overall market.</li>
<li>Beta of 1 means in line with the market.</li>
<li>Less than 1 means less reactive to market swings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="earnings-yield">Earnings Yield</h3>
<ul>
<li>Earnings Yield = Net Profit / Market Cap or P/E upside down</li>
<li>Good way to compare to treasury or bond yields to determine the attractiveness
of the investment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitroski-f-score">Pitroski F-score</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 2008, S&amp;P was nearly down by 40%.</li>
<li>Pitroski noticed when reviewing stocks with very low price-to-book value that
many of them were in poor  financial shape, unlikely to survive and deserving
of their low valuation. Piotroski set  out to devise a system to take these
low price-to-book stock lists and  mechanically filter out the ones that were
unlikely to survive and prosper,  leaving a number of potentially attractive
investment opportunities.</li>
<li>Nine different criterias for judging company&rsquo;s performance between past 2
years. Stock gets &lsquo;1&rsquo; for each criteria passed and &lsquo;0&rsquo; for if it does not. If
both years show identical value, &lsquo;0.5&rsquo; is given. All scores are then added up.
Scores greater than 8 are worthy of consideration.
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income</strong>: &lsquo;1&rsquo; if positive</li>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow</strong>: &lsquo;1&rsquo; if last year&rsquo;s operating cash flow number is
positive.</li>
<li><strong>Returns on Assets Increasing</strong>: &lsquo;1&rsquo; if last year&rsquo;s ROA is greater than prior year.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Earnings</strong>: &lsquo;1&rsquo; if operating cash flow &gt; Income.</li>
<li><strong>Long term debt vs Assets</strong>: &lsquo;1&rsquo; if long term debt to assets ratio is lower
than year ago number.</li>
<li><strong>Current ratio</strong>: &lsquo;1&rsquo; if short term assets/ short term liabilities ratio
greater than previous year.</li>
<li><strong>Shares Outstanding</strong>: &lsquo;1&rsquo; if outstanding shares is lower or same as prior year.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Margin</strong>: &lsquo;1&rsquo; if gross margin from last year exceeds previous year.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover</strong>: &lsquo;1&rsquo; if rise in revenues exceeds rise in total assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests #5 and #6 are good financial health measures, a problem with some MFI
stocks. Tests #2 and #7 can red flag potential accounting oddities, and some
of the others are measures of business momentum.</li>
</ul>
