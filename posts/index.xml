            <description>A Reminiscence   Looking at this image, I find it funny how we change so much that we are no longer ourselves. I believed I was this way for as long as I can remember but alas with time: memories fade, people around you change and you no longer are the same person that you were before. This is the first page of my diary I made in my 9th grade.</description>

<p>Looking at this image, I find it funny how we change so much that we are no
longer ourselves. I believed I was this way for as long as I can remember but
alas with time: memories fade, people around you change and you no longer are
the same person that you were before.
This is the first page of my diary I made in my 9th grade.
Looking at the aim I wrote in this diary, it feels so funny and grave misfortune
that I had no idea about the storm of life that was about to burst upon me with
all it&rsquo;s might. I so foolishly believed life was all about being the best in
exams. There&rsquo;s a catch here though: the people I was around, the people who
wanted me to have a bright successful life always came to me and said it: maybe
thousand times or more. My teachers, my parents, my relatives and everyone that
wished well for me.
Either they didn&rsquo;t know that life was so intricate and complex beyond you
passing exams and being best out of it. I believed it to be the holy grail that
would guide my life now.</p>
<p>Now, Walking along this path, I did what I believed. I became the best version
of who I could be with what I had. Then the wind hit me hard in my face as I
faced the winding road of life. There was no simple aim in anyone&rsquo;s life. I was
with my shield of <strong>being best in exams</strong> and in real life I was as naked as I
could be. Now, the arrows hit me from all sides: arrows being just education and
certificate doesn&rsquo;t make you who you want to be. Life told me: You need to learn
some life skills: hobbies that you can do when you are in pain so that you get
lost in yourself, skills that you can at least earn some money for your
expenses, ability to ask for what you want when you realize the world doesn&rsquo;t give a
damn about you and the fact that you have to go exploring the world rather than
success and happiness coming to you by default.</p>
<p>The quote I wrote there seems amazing to me since myself in that state was all
clear about his life and his path. Yet, that me knew what was going to happen
with my life. For all these years, this quote has been the summary of my life. I
feared ever trying to give 100% to anything. I always left when I felt it was
finally up to the top. I felt an urge to back down when I saw the peak. It was
never that I didn&rsquo;t have the knowledge or the skills I needed, it was just I was
afraid of falling on the way to the mountaintop.
All this has come to me after 8 years. I wished I could write this letter to
that me 8 years back.Would it have mattered? Would I have listened to myself? That&rsquo;s a
question that will forever remain.</p>
<p>I have gone through a horrible path to get out of this belief. I hope no child
is taught that exams are the way to better life: life is much more than that. I
hope noone has to go this long to realize their beliefs were a lie.</p>

            <title>Tentacles of Thoughts</title>

            <description>Inside the dark vents of my body,
Lies the vines: of growing darkness.
Trying to find it&amp;rsquo;s way to my brain,
It sweeps, explodes
It grunges from the inside.
 There used to be garden inside,
Thoughts laid peace within me.
Fights were always physical then,
Peace was a habit,
And thoughts resembled curiosity then.
 The darkness grew out of the worldly ways,
The stories of success,
The stories of failures,</description>

<p>Lies the vines: of growing darkness.</p>
<p>Trying to find it&rsquo;s way to my brain,</p>
<p>It sweeps, explodes</p>
<p>It grunges from the inside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There used to be garden inside,</p>
<p>Thoughts laid peace within me.</p>
<p>Fights were always physical then,</p>
<p>Peace was a habit,</p>
<p>And thoughts resembled curiosity then.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The darkness grew out of the worldly ways,</p>
<p>The stories of success,</p>
<p>The stories of failures,</p>
<p>The horrors of living,</p>
<p>The ephemeral life,</p>
<p>And the drive to thrive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>With a gasp it starts,</p>
<p>Slowly it finds it&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>Creepy they are,</p>
<p>Creeping through me like swinging vines,</p>
<p>Stranded and clogged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walls of mind and tentacles of thoughts,</p>
<p>The war of the microcosm,</p>
<p>The dance of the devil form.</p>
<p>My bones are still the same,</p>
<p>My muscles undeformed,</p>
<p>But it feels like</p>
<p>The quarks inside them want some deadly transform.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cold it is,</p>
<p>To fight with ownself.</p>
<p>Hard it is,</p>
<p>To break the chains of thoughts.</p>
<p>Pain it is,</p>
<p>To not understand anyone but ownself.</p>
<p>Peace it is,</p>
<p>To lay inside the box in peace</p>
<p>With tentacles of thoughts buried to the ground.</p>

            <description>Peak they saw,
Thought they made,
Of the day when their steps would be on the mountain peak,
Clear seem&amp;rsquo;d they, Of the goal they desperately seek.
 Guided by the river trail,
Dreams flew high against the flow,
The mountains of hope: deep and strong first,
Now saw the wind of fear that slowly blow.
 The path feels rough now,
The silent howls of people&amp;rsquo;s voice he heard,</description>

            <description>तिम्रो बोली गुलाबको फूल मनमा भने काँडा रैछ
झुटो मेरो वचन होइन पापी तिम्रो आँखा रैछ ।
माया प्रेमको अन्धकारमा हराएको मेरो दृष्टि
नयन हेर्दा निर्दोष तिमी मनमा भने ढुसी रैछ ।
सुन्दरताको मोहजालमा तड्पाएर मेरो शरीर
अङ्ग भङ्ग पारी शरीर बेच्ने तिम्रो चाहा रैछ ।
जीवनको नाटककी पारङ्गत कलाकार तिमी
मायाको अमृतमा लोभ्याएर विष मिसाई पीलाउनु रैछ ।
तिम्रो केशको छायाँमा नै जीवन जिउँछु भन्ने मलाई
त्यै केशको फन्दा बनाई प्याक्क पारी मार्नु रैछ ।</description>

            <description>आकाङ्क्षाका पानाहरुमा
समेटिएको यो जीवनमा
च्यातिएका ती पानाहरु
स्वयमहित्को तान्डवसँगै
कुल्चिएका भावनाहरु ।
तिनै जलेका पानाहरु
धुँवा बनी उडेको छ
संसार जस्तो भएपनि
अदृश्यतामा रमेकोछ ।
हिमालका ती कोप्चारामा
हिउँसँगै जमेकोछ ।।
 सुरको धुनमा बज्दा यसलाई
शब्दकोशमा खोजेपछि
आफुलाई नचाहरि
धर्मग्रन्थ रटेपछि
न्यायका ती किताबले नै
सत्यतालाई ढाकेपछि ।
सत्य आज मरिसक्यो
जीवनलाई छाडेपछि
मृत्यु सत्य बनिसक्यो
सत्य खोज्न थालेपछि ।।
 गढिमाईको मन्दीरमा
मृत्यु नै त सत्य बन्यो</description>
