            <description>I have been trying to write some essays on basic words that are the hardest to capture because often times it&amp;rsquo;s these words that stir up conflict: love, happiness, fulfillment, peace, pain, god, spirituality etc. Because they are the most overused, yet least understood by our subconscious minds, our subconscious gets trippy while making sense.

Because they are the most overused, yet least understood by our subconscious minds, our subconscious gets trippy while making sense.
I started writing this essay about six months ago.  In trying to write this essay, I started by searching for word love in my personal notes vault. It got overwhelming even after a day digesting, that I gave up the pursuit for some time. I really didn&rsquo;t have any digest apart from notes and excerpts from others. I knew where to start, but couldn&rsquo;t end it.</p>
<p>This is where I start. Where is love word used often? Whenever anyone feels like there is an intensity of anything, they call it love.
Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desire</strong> : Love for ownership</li>
<li><strong>Passion</strong> : Love for fulfillment</li>
<li><strong>Sex</strong> : Love for pleasure</li>
<li><strong>Flow</strong> : Love for work</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.
If love is just intensity at its peak, why is love praised that much? Can you call intense greed as love for greed? If not, why do you call high intensity to cause violence as <strong>love for violence</strong>. If it can be used on any connotation, is there really anything praiseworthy about it?
e.g.</p>
<p><strong>Paulo Coelho in The Alchemist</strong> says maybe love simply is nourishment and compares love to a falcon&rsquo;s flight over the sand being definition of love given by the desert. The desert reasons that falcon carries bits of itself, and feeds the falcon little water that it has right there; thus the nourishment.</p>
<p><strong>Lao Tzu in Tao Te Ching</strong> talks about love without imposing the will, love as a leader, love as a mystery, and posits a spiritual question. &ldquo;Is greatest love indifferent?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Gracia Marquez in One Hundred Years of Solitude</strong> shows how you see love everywhere, how passion and love interchangably entangle, whether we can be exhausted of love, and whether two solitary people can be in love.
Charles Bukwoski has a book titled &ldquo;Love is a dog from hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There will be thousand more references to word love if you google it. I deferred this essay and  had been trying to answer other questions related to fear and death instead for last year. All of a sudden, both the answers came at the same time. Finally, I had an essay I wanted to share.</p>
<p>I want to make note of what&rsquo;s easiest about describing love. Love with a person. Though I start with romantic love, the conclusion applies to any love. Love with a person, thing, God, or anything.
I will start with loving someone as I have come to know it. I have been close with a few people emotionally. Had multitudes of experience from love at first sight ( in people&rsquo;s words ) to being in a relationship. I have connected with someone on a purely intellectual level where we had so much topics in common that we talked for hours on end, and never get tired. I have been emotionally involved with someone who matched most of my interests. It was fun to talk to and hangout with that someone. I thought I was at least in love when I was with someone in a relationship, in possessing someone whom I called mine. At that time I thought life was about one love and I believed it to be love for a very long time. Then I liked someone, wanted to be with them, but never really feeling like being with them. At some point, I saw love in trying to emapthize for someone. There were few days where situation would make it feel like a perfect match but that was pleasure misinterpreted as love.</p>
<p>What people call love at first sight was all hormones piling up to give one of the most pleasurable experiences, but not really love. On my first ever love at first sight, I really felt music buzz my ears, stomach curled up when I saw her. I was sure she was an angel that evening. But hormones fade, as fast as they pile up. That&rsquo;s what love at first sight is. It&rsquo;s a biological response of you liking someone because nature wants you to breed.</p>
<p>Being intimate emotionally and intellectually with someone is freedom, one degree close to love than even that pleasure where you had a crush. You put down your guards. It&rsquo;s not overwhelming like the first one, but much more relieving. A crush moment is instantaneous, but intimacy lasts.</p>
<p>Being in a relationship came as a whole different story. They are already as important as your family, and when you have accepted their most vices as inconsequential is even more closer to love than anything else. This is what I thought was love till the moment because that was all that I had experienced. You possess them as yours. You feel safe with them. Most of the feeling comes from not having an emotional void to express with someone when in a relationship.</p>
<p>I thought that was all there is. Thus, I believed the highest attainment is love where two people are in a relationship, like each other, and spend their lives together. They are individuals, but they like spending their life together rather than all alone.</p>
<p>Then came my final experience, which needed me to redefine what I had known so far.
This is love where I experienced this wierdness that I had a difficult time finding words to describe.</p>
<p>Lets start with a context first.</p>
<p>I had crush on someone for some time. I got to talking with that someone, meeting them too. At that time, I was trying to see as many people as I can, in a hope to understand myself better. That someone didn&rsquo;t want to take it forward, so I left that situation the best I can. I was dating other people, but very briefly. I got stuck on that someone.</p>
<p>I was still unsure whether I wanted to be with them in a preparation for longer run since I fell for that person too quickly without knowing them enough. And making decisions quickly on emotional matters is not my forte. I tried hard to move away from them, dated a few other people, but still stuck.</p>
<p>I had one doubt about that person being the right match, that&rsquo;s why I never went all in. One day while reading a book, I came to an understanding that opened my barrier.
It had been an year or so since I had last talked. I decided to take a chance and take it as it goes even if it ends up breaking me. I called to meet and that someone agreed.</p>
<p>First I was happy, then I was anxious. I almost have forgotted how anxiety feels like because I was experiencing any sort of anxiety after almost a year. To give you context, I have been meditating for years now, and am rarely anxious. That day, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep and decided to meditate.</p>
<p>Meditation is where my inner lake gets calm. Half an hour into that, I realized anxiety arises from desire, not from love. I still meditated. There is a practice called &ldquo;Metta&rdquo; ( Good will ) that&rsquo;s done at the end of Vipassana meditation practice. It usually is done for the last five minutes, but I decided to do it amidst my one hour practice that day. Also, I decided to do Metta just for that someone. In that practice of radiating love, after 10 minutes or so, my desire slowly faded away. Voila!! There was no anxiety.</p>
<p>I was peaceful, full of love, and cheerful. It felt so fucking weird that I couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it. It didn&rsquo;t last very long, about an hour or so after I woke from meditation. But at that moment, I felt blissed like I had never been before. The weiredest part is that I was unafraid of even death. It felt like even if someone stabbed me in that moment, I would die peacefully with a smile on my face. There was one more catch to it: I had always heard about how ego is the final barrier in spiritual path, to which I realized I had no ego that whole time. Not even a tinge of it. I was ready to give anything and everything up cheerfully.</p>
<p>I had been reading and meditating on death and fear for almost an year now in trying to overcome it. I had built a decent enough understanding about the topics, but not really nailed it. I was still seeking for an answer. I had no idea that my answer would come this way.</p>
<p>Even when that someone decided lastly that they didn&rsquo;t want to meet me, I wasn&rsquo;t in a fight to relieve myself of my experiences. I remained aware and calm. I wanted to feel everything in its fullest depth. My logical mind couldn&rsquo;t  make sense because that was not how people I saw dealt with heartbreak neither in real life nor in movies. I wanted to just feel everything without diverting it by movies, songs, drinking, or activity of any sort. Seeing this, my mind created a doubt as to whether I really was in love or I was just faking myself. Because that experience was way too vivid and absorbing, denying that wasn&rsquo;t easy.</p>
<p>Days passed and I still couldn&rsquo;t  believe what happened that day.
Over a period of a month, I came across some references that described what I felt. I stumbled across couple more references, and then I finally found my answer as to what happened.</p>
<p>First is a story told by Osho:
One day desire and knowledge met with Ganga. Ganga told both of them that she would purify them. Knowledge didn&rsquo;t go but desire did. When desired came purified out of the river, it&rsquo;d became love.</p>
<p>I found few Rumi&rsquo;s quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>From understading comes love.</li>
<li>Exhale only love.</li>
<li>Close your eyes, fall in love, stay there.</li>
<li>You have within you more love than you could ever understand.</li>
<li>Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guy was in love like no one else. I felt connection to these lines immediately after seeing one. It would have been impossible for me to express it, had it not been this guy who had said it already. My experience would have been lost to my logic and memory had I not found his lines.</p>
<p>Finally, it does not like a hallucination or a dream I created. Though that state lasted only an hour or so, that was real. That was how Rumi loved The Godhead. That&rsquo;s what love as in love is. Everything else is love added with something: sometimes with desire, sometimes with pleasure, sometimes with work, sometimes with passion etc.</p>
<p><strong>This is my essay &ldquo;On Love&rdquo;.</strong></p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>I read word &ldquo;Bardo&rdquo; for the first time in <strong><strong>Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</strong></strong>. When I read <strong><strong>The Tibetan Book of Dying and Living</strong></strong>, I found out that <strong><strong>Bardo</strong></strong> was a Tibetan word taken into English, and has a very big significance in Tibetan.</li>
<li>Tibetans are very clear about stages after death, re-incarnation, enlightenment on par with our clarity about daily tasks we do.</li>
<li>The more I read about neuroscience, the more I love reading philosophy.</li>
<li>On Sanskrit and Sanskrit Texts:
<ul>
<li>Sanskrit Grammar is such an elegant topic that was written a long time ago. I have no problem with people rejecting anything, but if we have no appreciation for the roots that we gave to the world, we are losing our identity into it. Sanskrit Grammar is one of the first complete grammar of any language in the world. Very elaborate.</li>
<li>I am more intrigued by Eastern Philosophy because it&rsquo;s easy to understand, easy because it fills gaps from our traditions, other related stories like Puranas, and folklores. Since Nepali language is derived from Sanskrit as well, I can contemplate some ideas from Sanskrit into my mind directly too. I have at least learned primitive level Sanskrit Grammar.</li>
<li>Most of the Buddhist texts were originally written in Sanskrit and Pali. Still to this day, Tibetans read both Sanskrit and Tibetan translation.</li>
<li>In Nepal and India, we see Hinduism as this giant ball of tradition. We, as intellectuals, need to be able to separate contemporary usefulness of traditions from philosophy, and give it a fair chance without making it a mockery by comparing it with Western Philosophy.</li>
<li>Upanishads are the lesser known beautiful extracts of Hindu tradition that comes under <strong>Vedanta</strong>. Upanishads are called <strong>Vedanta</strong> [ The End of Vedas ] because it&rsquo;s said that they contain all the teachings of Veda in a more succinct form. Philosophical foods of thought that have been neglected because it&rsquo;s hard to make philosophy a part of tradition unlike stories ( a.k.a Puranas ). There are many Upanishads, but 108 principal ones. Among them, 9 or 11 are said to be of significant importance. They are just like a few poems long.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make Something Wonderful by Steve Jobs is a simple yet beautiful book on how Steve&rsquo;s mind worked. And, it really is inspiring for someone who wants to build stuff for people.</li>
<li>Every school should teach <strong><strong>How to Read a Book</strong></strong>. Reading is not just memorizing or marking something as complete. Reading is much more. And it depends on what you are reading. You shouldn&rsquo;t read everything the same way. Like Francis Bacon said, &ldquo;Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s easier said than done.</li>
<li>Having a kindle really helps me because I can pick and drop books at any time without feeling guilty about it. I usually have around 200 books on my kindle.</li>
<li>If you are curious about getting overview and some details into theory of consciousness, <strong><strong>Being You</strong></strong> by Anil Seth is a great book. I loved his talks through the years, and this is a good digest of the whole field of consciousness and his theory of it.</li>
<li>Read Psychology so you can understand your mind better. Reading Psychology + Meditating helps me clarify a lot of my confusions, and helps me accept conclusions that I don&rsquo;t feel like accepting.</li>
<li>I have been pretty intrigued by death for a year or two now because I see it as hindrance to my true fulfillment. How can I truly be if I am always running away from something invisible? I still have amends to make, but a lot of ideas have been still like a lake on my mind. It&rsquo;s not that the waves don&rsquo;t come, but they settle quickly. I hope to be in equanimity with death soon enough, so that I can truly live.</li>
<li>Zen is nothing more nothing less than mindfulness. There can be a thousand teachings and koans, but the essence is to simply be. The closest example of Zen that you can understand is Kung Fu Panda. Compare Master Shifu, Po, and Master Oogway; right in that comparison is answer to what Zen is. Knowing is one thing; accepting is another which you can learn from Shifu.</li>
<li>I am really loving <strong>Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any recommendations, or want certain recommendations; hit me up.</p>

            <description>We all identify our bodies as &amp;ldquo;my body&amp;rdquo; and not me directly. The whole idea of this blog post revolves around this idea. The purpose of this blog post is to establish an idea on how to build healthier lifestyle based on this concept.
It&amp;rsquo;s not like we intentionally don&amp;rsquo;t want to build healthier habits. We try to pick up exercise habits, but we are too lazy to work on it.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We all identify our bodies as &ldquo;my body&rdquo; and <strong>not me directly</strong>. The whole idea of this blog post revolves around this idea. The purpose of this blog post is to establish an idea on how to build healthier lifestyle based on this concept.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we intentionally don&rsquo;t want to build healthier habits. We try to pick up exercise habits, but we are too lazy to work on it. We eat haphazardly, and without any consideration to our health. It&rsquo;s a very universal problem. So, I had the same problem. On top of that, I have always been a person low in Conscientiousness, which means I used to have a hard time pushing my goals to myself if I was the only one responsible for it. Finally, I found a way that worked for me that might work for you too.</p>
<p>So, the main idea is this:
Instead of thinking of my body as me (same identity), I changed the scenario by treating &ldquo;my body&rdquo; as being separate from &ldquo;me&rdquo;. Now, There are two players in the game.
Player 1 : Me[ My emotions, cravings, feelings ]
Player 2 : My body [ Physical body ]
Both of whom are playing an optimization game to favor themselves.</p>
<p>My body communicates via muscle signals, dis-ease, etc. My thoughts are self-evident.</p>
<p>For me, the game started looking like a zero-sum optimization game at the beginning. e.g. Either I was taking care of my health or I was fulfilling my cravings, and feel-good emotions. But as I came to understand intentions of both players [ my body and me ] with more clarity, the same game resurfaced as a positive-sum game. This change of the game itself happened as my perspective on what I was optimizing for aligned with what my body wanted to optimize. In simpler terms, I&rsquo;d thought building healthy habits would be boring which turned out to be a false proposition.</p>
<p>I started by clarifying the goals of each player in this optimization game. Each goal has time to feedback as well as importance of feedback. Based on a weighted sum of feedback, based on time as well as importance, the decision&rsquo;s made. Initially, the goals and their characteristics looked as follows:</p>
<h2 id="goal-for-agent-1--me">Goal for agent 1 ( me )</h2>
<ol>
<li>Tastes good : Immediate feedback, High importance to feedback.</li>
<li>Feels good ( e.g. Drinking alcohol in other&rsquo;s company though it doesn&rsquo;t taste good ): Immediate feedback, High importance to feedback.</li>
<li>Avoid any physical pain : No immediate feedback since punishment&rsquo;s delayed in time. Low importance to feedback. ( e.g. I don&rsquo;t immediately get obese. )</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="goal-for-agent-2--my-body">Goal for agent 2 ( my body )</h2>
<ol>
<li>Not be obese : Very long feedback time</li>
<li>Not have bowel difficulties : Medium feedback time</li>
<li>No soar muscles : Medium feedback time</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>OVERALL GOAL</strong> : Lesser conflicts between body and mind.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: From now on, I might refer to <strong>me as player 1</strong> and <strong>my body as player 2</strong>.</p>
<p>So, this optimization game is biased more towards me feeling good than my body feeling good because the feedback loops associated to the game have easy short-time feedback circuits that favor Player 1. So, it&rsquo;s obvious that the game&rsquo;s results favor me feeling good in the short term rather than both me and my body feeling good in a longer term. So, I needed a way to overcome that.</p>
<p>The optimization game&rsquo;s thus defined. The players in the game are defined. The goals associated with the players are defined. The weight of each action for these players in relation to the goal is defined.</p>
<p>To maximize my overall goal, I thus needed to find a way to make Player 2&rsquo;s goals being equally considered as Player 1&rsquo;s are. I had to change weights on the game in some way that it doesn&rsquo;t discount short-term rewards favoring Player 1 over Player 2&rsquo;s fulfillment.</p>
<p>If I can do this, this changes the situation for Player 2 in the game so both players have an equal say for actions that affect them both.</p>
<p>This is how I increased Player 2&rsquo;s impact in the optimization game. I defined my relationship to my body like a &ldquo;close friend&rdquo;. What that means is that I&rsquo;ll have to maintain basic requisites for being my body&rsquo;s friend. I cannot just abuse it right away, and expect it to maintain a good relationship with me. I cannot be absolutely naive with my best friend, but we can be a bit abusive to each other every now and then. By hitting rough edges and coming together, our friendships get stronger. I treat my body in a similar fashion now.</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s talk about this with some examples</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I want to drink, but I won&rsquo;t go drinking one day after another just to feel good. I will restrain my taste to let my body feel good as well. My body feeling good is me feeling good too but in a longer feedback loop which doesn&rsquo;t feel evident immediately. I will eat unhealthy food randomly over a week but only certain times a week. I don&rsquo;t want to piss my body off. So every time I eat something that&rsquo;s unhealthy, I tell my body to take care of it this time. And my body usually takes care of fewer messes I create. Hence, There will only be a few incidents when I act harshly with my body. Even when I do, there will be a difference in one action after the other, so that we both feel good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, I don&rsquo;t want to exercise. But, my body doesn&rsquo;t want to feel sore because of inactivity. I immediately put exercise as my top priority whenever my body feels even a bit sore. I have to be there for my friend when my friend needs me. On top of that, I&rsquo;ll do exercise sparsely over the week without any schedule since it gives me a dopamine hit immediately afterwards. Previously, I would avoid doing a single physical exercise over months on end whenever I felt busy from my work, but can&rsquo;t avoid like that now. My friend might just fuck me over if I don&rsquo;t maintain my basic friendship. And that puts some obligation to exercise mentally.</p>
<p>I had an interesting insight that came along with this change of weight for Player 2. In trying to change weights of the game for Player 2, the game redefined itself into a 2-player positive sum game. How can this be the case given that our goals conflicted each other ?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This happened because I thought eating healthy would be boring. Doing exercise would be boring. But, once you pass the tipping point, you actually start loving the dopamine hit. Now, it feels good to eat healthy. It feels good to not drink on subsequent days. And, my friends rarely push me to break my restraint. Now, it&rsquo;s a positive sum optimization game. My body helps me have fun. I help my body feel good. We both feel good.</p>
<p>I have been spending time thinking why this fooling technique even works at all as well. It sounds so silly, to which, I too agree without a doubt. But, it has worked for me really well over past few years. I have kept my aggressive sinusitis in check, prevented myself from getting fat all over my stomach, and feeling back pain every now and then.</p>
<p>This positive sum game implies that we both try to optimize for each other&rsquo;s best and take care of it to get net positive output for both players.</p>
<p>My reasoning to why this works comes from what modern researchers believe why meditation works.
They note that whenever you meditate, you see your emotions from a 3rd person perspective, without identifying yourself to the same degree, as when you aren&rsquo;t in meditation. We cannot observe facts with clarity when we feel overwhelmed. Thus, by decreasing the intensity of our emotions, meditation helps connect the dots that we were too clouded to see beforehand.
This practice with my body, is in a sense similar, since it detaches me from my body so that I can&rsquo;t do whatever I desire. That decreases the intensity of what I feel in short-term. Because what I desire in the short term is usually not what I want for myself in the long term, I needed to find a way to de-intensify the short term rewards similar to de-intensifying my overwhelming emotions. And the way is to treat my body as a foreign agent ( not me ).</p>

<li>Mindfulness
<ul>
<li>Knowing what you are thinking of and what is happening internally will help
you understand how irrational thoughts surface and develop with time.</li>
<li>To help with thought interruptions, keep a timer, rubber band or something
that constantly stays with you and add it to your lifestyle purposefully
for that mental activity interruption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gratitude
<ul>
<li>Feel good for all the small yet beautiful things in life. This helps build
positive hormones in the brain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Challenge irrationalities
<ul>
<li>When you find yourself nagging without any evidence, challenge yourself to
find evidences for it. Bring logic and rationality to the picture; will
help you realize the futility of a thought drain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditate
<ul>
<li>Any way of meditation is helpful for your mind since it&rsquo;s the time you
accept to recognize yourself without subconsciously living a life and
accepting everything that&rsquo;s out there. It will help you get insights, be
more peaceful as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visualization
<ul>
<li>Visualization are amazing tools of positive affirmations. If you can
imagine yourself doing and believe it, it will help you attract that
effect. Imagine yourself being confident just like a mantra to repeat at
certain times. This will push yourself to work as well.</li>

            <description>Procrastination ID: 2e93fc98-6218-4630-8ff0-1d30c3f6849c Problem 1: Immensity of work You commit to wiping out an entire forest instead of actually starting to work with a single tree at the moment. What happens?
Even before starting, the mental pressure of the whole big hill over you makes you more afraid even to start. You try to console yourself that you can do it in some later point as you don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy to do it now or some reason to justify not to do it now.</description>

<h3 id="problem-1-immensity-of-work">Problem 1: Immensity of work</h3>
<ul>
<li>You commit to wiping out an entire forest instead of actually starting to
work with a single tree at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Even before starting, the mental pressure of the whole big hill over you makes
you more afraid even to start. You try to console yourself that you can do it
in some later point as you don&rsquo;t have the energy to do it now or some reason
to justify not to do it now. The immensity makes it difficult even after days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>Break down a big task into as simple tasks as possible. Like breaking down a
big rock into pebbles. The pebbles should be as simple as they can be such as
setting up your environment and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-2-fear-of-actual-results">Problem 2: Fear of actual results</h3>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to get gratification by saying: &ldquo;I could have done that amazing task
and I know I would be great at it&rdquo;. You are taking this mental gratification
as a justification for not doing the task at hand. Remember: <strong>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t edit
a blank page.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>If you think people will judge you for your results and you think it will make
you feel bad. In fact, people don&rsquo;t even care for most of us. Just because you
have over 1000 friends on Facebook, hundreds of followers on Instagram doesn&rsquo;t
mean they are interested in you. People aren&rsquo;t computers. Even the strongest
of memories fade away: People have to have a grudge on you to remember small
things that you failed even if you failed small. Will you care about them and
not work?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-3-jumbled-physical-spaces">Problem 3: Jumbled physical spaces</h3>
<ul>
<li>You watch movie, read and sleep on the same bed.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>You have no specific place that you can work on so that sitting on the space
itself helps you commit to work you put off for a long time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution     :ATTACH:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your mind&rsquo;s accustomed to working things as automatically as you can.
Creative people, players and even commonly us: We do things unconsciously upon
being in different kinds of environment. Your brain&rsquo;s amazing and does tasks
on it&rsquo;s own as much as it can. But these automatic tasks might not be
favorable at instances. Your body understands to feel drowsy and sleepy when
in bed; So when you feel like being the most productive person on the planet
in your bed, your brain fails you miserably.</p>
<p>So, instead of quarreling with the hundreds of years of evolution, take it to
your advantage. If you separate spaces for your work, sleep and rest; now this
habit of brain helps you to work when you are at physical space representing
work: either it&rsquo;s simple table and chair for you or an entire study room.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-4-no-actionable-tasks">Problem 4: No actionable tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even your planned tasks are vague and need more thinking.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Your tasks need thinking even after you made the plan. Now you drown down the
rabbit hole and the whole loop starts again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ol>
<li>Two minute rule: Tasks that take two minutes now: just slash them out of your
list. Your list is precious and needs to be as clean as possible. These two
minutes task if ignored for now might take longer later on.</li>
<li>Make tasks actionable: Don&rsquo;t drown into thoughts again : I will do this or
that and all of it. Make simple tasks that you can clearly see yourself
working and start doing it.</li>
<li>Start with something that you find best in that whole rock: a simple crystal
you like. It might not be the first thing to do but to keep you on track and
inspire you: it will be the best place to start.</li>
<li>Plan tasks with actual schedule. Don&rsquo;t even think of situations where you can
compromise later. What if someone calls me for party? This is the worst
thing you can do now. What happens and what to be done if such thing happens
is to be taken care of at that very moment it happens. Don&rsquo;t ever fall into
that trap.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-5-you-are-a-perfectionist">Problem 5: You are a perfectionist</h3>
<ul>
<li>You feel like you have to be the best out there and shouldn&rsquo;t do something
that&rsquo;s not amazing.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a perfectionist but realist at the same time helps but just making
perfect imaginations of anything doesn&rsquo;t help at all. Learn the art of the
start. Be relentless to perfection but for god&rsquo;s sake start with any output
you can have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>We all want to have the best versions of ourselves to show to others. Noone
wants to be seen weak or incapable. But it&rsquo;s people who start with anything
they have, improvise over time are the ones who accomplish the most. It&rsquo;s okay
to be afraid because it&rsquo;s deep rooted in our brain from earlier times of
evolution. It&rsquo;s a social coping mechanism. People who weren&rsquo;t accepted by
society back in hunting days would die or be killed. We have changed but our
brains are wired the same way. Don&rsquo;t stress over it. Just give time to see
people doing imperfect things. You can start by looking at works of your
favorite YouTubers and movie stars so that you know people you thought are
perfect now were not perfect from the very start. They improvised over time to
be who they are now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-6-tasks-that-need-internet">Problem 6: Tasks that need Internet</h3>
<ul>
<li>You start working with all your enthusiasm when a certain notification bell
rings on your phone or you start with 10 minutes of Facebook time.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>You get lost searching for things on the internet related to your task and
find at the end of the day that you spent a whole day watching YouTube videos
and browsing Facebook or Reddit or anything you hadn&rsquo;t planned for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>In today&rsquo;s time, most of us can&rsquo;t work without using internet. While all the
media companies and businesses over internet are there to lure you to spend
more time on their platform, it&rsquo;s a very hard escape out of it. They have been
studying our psychologies and preferences even those which we are not even
conscious of. So, the best thing we can do is be aware. Be present at the
moment. Have a stopwatch tick before you start using Internet or regular
interval checks to at least know when you have plunged into it.
Doing this simple act will change you over time. It&rsquo;s not an overnight thing
but it will create some significant changes.</li>
<li>Use site blockers: the stricter the better. Some cannot even be uninstalled
after you activate them. Make sure to make it as difficult  as possible to
stop them. e.g. Trigger stopping it to deleting all your movies and music from
your hard drive. Just giving some ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="few-last-tips">Few Last Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use Pomodoro technique if you like it. It helps make tasks look simple in
terms of time to commit to tasks.</li>
<li>Use your morning to give a momentum for the day. Just accomplishing simple
tasks as folding your bed or cleaning up your room can give you a feeling of
gratitude and push you to break some more rocks ahead.</li>
<li>Getting Things Done is a nice way to organize your todo lists.</li>
<li>Try to make a weekly review of your todo list so that you know what are
blocking you. You can do shorter reviews such as in 3 days. The faster the
review time: the better the feedback loop. You know your problems better.</li>
</ul>

            <description>A Reminiscence Looking at this image, I find it funny how we change so much that we are no longer ourselves.

<p>Looking at this image, I find it funny how we change so much that we are no
longer ourselves. I believed I was this way for as long as I can remember but
alas with time: memories fade, people around you change and you no longer are
the same person that you were before.
This is the first page of my diary I made in my 9th grade.
Looking at the aim I wrote in this diary, it feels so funny and grave misfortune
that I had no idea about the storm of life that was about to burst upon me with
all it&rsquo;s might. I so foolishly believed life was all about being the best in
exams. There&rsquo;s a catch here though: the people I was around, the people who
wanted me to have a bright successful life always came to me and said it: maybe
thousand times or more. My teachers, my parents, my relatives and everyone that
wished well for me.
Either they didn&rsquo;t know that life was so intricate and complex beyond you
passing exams and being best out of it. I believed it to be the holy grail that
would guide my life now.</p>
<p>Now, Walking along this path, I did what I believed. I became the best version
of who I could be with what I had. Then the wind hit me hard in my face as I
faced the winding road of life. There was no simple aim in anyone&rsquo;s life. I was
with my shield of <strong>being best in exams</strong> and in real life I was as naked as I
could be. Now, the arrows hit me from all sides: arrows being just education and
certificate doesn&rsquo;t make you who you want to be. Life told me: You need to learn
some life skills: hobbies that you can do when you are in pain so that you get
lost in yourself, skills that you can at least earn some money for your
expenses, ability to ask for what you want when you realize the world doesn&rsquo;t give a
damn about you and the fact that you have to go exploring the world rather than
success and happiness coming to you by default.</p>
<p>The quote I wrote there seems amazing to me since myself in that state was all
clear about his life and his path. Yet, that me knew what was going to happen
with my life. For all these years, this quote has been the summary of my life. I
feared ever trying to give 100% to anything. I always left when I felt it was
finally up to the top. I felt an urge to back down when I saw the peak. It was
never that I didn&rsquo;t have the knowledge or the skills I needed, it was just I was
afraid of falling on the way to the mountaintop.
All this has come to me after 8 years. I wished I could write this letter to
that me 8 years back.Would it have mattered? Would I have listened to myself? That&rsquo;s a
question that will forever remain.</p>
<p>I have gone through a horrible path to get out of this belief. I hope no child
is taught that exams are the way to better life: life is much more than that. I
hope noone has to go this long to realize their beliefs were a lie.</p>

            <description>Inside the dark vents of my body,
Lies the vines: of growing darkness.
Trying to find it&amp;rsquo;s way to my brain,
It sweeps, explodes
It grunges from the inside.
There used to be garden inside,
Thoughts laid peace within me.
Fights were always physical then,
Peace was a habit,
And thoughts resembled curiosity then.
The darkness grew out of the worldly ways,
The stories of success,
The stories of failures,</description>

<p>The quarks inside them want some deadly transform.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cold it is,</p>
<p>To fight with ownself.</p>
<p>Hard it is,</p>
<p>To break the chains of thoughts.</p>
<p>Pain it is,</p>
<p>To not understand anyone but ownself.</p>
<p>Peace it is,</p>
<p>To lay inside the box in peace</p>
<p>With tentacles of thoughts buried to the ground.</p>

            <description>Peak they saw,
Thought they made,
Of the day when their steps would be on the mountain peak,
Clear seem&amp;rsquo;d they, Of the goal they desperately seek.
Guided by the river trail,
Dreams flew high against the flow,
The mountains of hope: deep and strong first,
Now saw the wind of fear that slowly blow.
The path feels rough now,
The silent howls of people&amp;rsquo;s voice he heard,
Of those who got lost on that way,</description>

            <description>The journey of it starts with a recommendation from two of my friends. I, being desperate to experience something spiritual and majestic, decided to take on a 10 day Vipasana course. Being an Engineering student from tech related field, it&amp;rsquo;s quiet essential for you to cope through the old dying syllabus and find yourself some life through the Internet. The rapid outbursts in Physics and Technology like the Neural Networks,researches on the quantum field with startling papers like &amp;ldquo;Universe shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist&amp;rdquo; made my mind wander a lot beyond my control.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The journey of it starts with a recommendation from two of my friends. I, being desperate to experience something spiritual and majestic, decided to take on a 10 day Vipasana course.
Being an Engineering student from tech related field, it&rsquo;s quiet essential for you to cope through the old dying syllabus and find yourself some life through the Internet. The rapid outbursts in Physics and Technology like the Neural Networks,researches on the quantum field with startling papers like &ldquo;Universe shouldn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; made my mind wander a lot beyond my control.
It was as if knowledge was on a different level trying to exploit the unconscious parts of the universal intellect as well as mine. Having read a lot but pretty much experienced nothing in particular as per I read, it was one of the reasons to give a fair try. But mostly I wanted a piece of my mind to recognize my deep interests among the disruptive tech bubbles in a 10 days self-exploration. Now it&rsquo;s time to move.</p>
<p>The South East Asia is quiet known for it&rsquo;s spiritual gifts to the West. But there is a run between these two sides: running towards one another.
But with the hike of knowledge at a tremendous pace, people have been quiet keen towards ancient wisdom and spirituality more than ever at this point of time. I told my parents about it and they were shocked to see their son go for a meditation. The fear was quiet clear: If I discard the ways of society and talk of high philosophies like a monk leaving the normal life back away.
We are quiet amazing people,you see. We always are proud of the fact that Buddha was born in our country but are afraid to even take a step towards learning his teachings. You, me and most of us are same. It&rsquo;s just the ways we are afraid to go against the ways our minds are shaped for the past few centuries. We are evolving, breaking chains wherever we can but a very tardy pace.
I somehow managed to convince them to go for it and now it officially starts.</p>
<p>This is my experience on a substantial level because the kind of internal experience is kinda difficult to explain in a few words.</p>
<p>It was at Dhamma Pokhara I was going to meditate. Started from Begnas bus station, I had to reach the center by 1 and found out buses move in about every 30 minutes. So, I bought myself a cold drink bottle and decided to move. Hey bro, don&rsquo;t talk about even a bottle of coke man. It&rsquo;s boring. Yeah I know but lets see whats up next. My mind is fickle and I contemplate a lot. On a scale out of 10, might be 11 as well. I asked a local for time to reach center from the station who said it was about 15 to 20 minutes. It was about 12:20 when I started. I walked like till 12:45 and asked a person on the way and again like 10 to 15 minutes. It happens a lot of time, maybe even to you too.I got a bus fortunately. On the way, I felt like If I take bottle of coke to meditation, they would feel like if I was not really up for meditation, so I threw it away. The reason I got myself then makes me laugh at myself now. They gave instruction for direction but I got confused on the words used to explain it. I asked a man nearby where Vipasana was and he didn&rsquo;t know the word.I wandered around and reached there by 12:55.</p>
<p>I was shocked by the view. I mean the people: almost everyone was like with these huge baggages and I had like a couple of clothes for 10 days and a brush only to be honest.Actually, I was thinking to get soap and a paste on the way but rush took everything out. They had like meditational tools and I was like Oh fuck, How do I even fit here? Then it started. I was even worrying for the interview they wrote on the email. What if I they send me home back? Actually there was no interview at all. I kept myself busy with these disturbing thoughts.
Now you get a pretty clear idea of this creepy guy to go for a meditation. I was in a group of 17 males and there were just two other Nepalese people, quiet old and couldn&rsquo;t understand English. The meditation was to start from tomorrow officially, so we were allowed to talk that day till the orientation at 5 pm.</p>
<p>Now, the talk started. I started to talk with an Indian guy. We were like in a group of three and this Nepalese uncle said he already had this experience. So we started listening to him. I was pretty much the translator for these guys. The uncle talked in Nepali and I would tell the Indian guy in English and vice versa. So, the philosophies were quiet high from the uncle&rsquo;s experience as he spoke. He spoke pretty much like a big guru does. I was constantly feeling a lot of exaggeration. When I got to know the Indian guy from the North East part of India, He was so cool and amazing. We were talking of the spiritual things around the world where I told him about my experience of meditation high on weed and got to know about LSD, DMT and bigger mind game changers. He told me DMT trip was like a time travel trip. I thought it was exaggeration too but as I got to know him more maybe there&rsquo;s a chance of being it partially true. He was up around with knowledge of the world from IBM&rsquo;s Watson to Neural networks although by profession, He is a baker. Baker, listening this word you might get a feeling and a poor complaint image. I pretty much would have done so if I hadn&rsquo;t learned him earlier.
But he was pretty much what I wanted in my life till that time. A search for spirituality, lot of traveling and a cool life. It was pretty much the way I wished myself to morph to.</p>
<p>Talking was amazing and the view of the common junction of male and female areas (There was a complete segregation of male and female residences, kitchen and all except the meditation hall for 10 days) Yeah, pretty hard to not take a look if you find someone attractive. I talked to other few. So, it was said in email about 17 males. I haven&rsquo;t talked to them properly so I put a nickname over everyone to contemplate about these people for 10 days.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to them:
Me, The Amazing Indian Guy, The Nepalese uncle, The Nepalese Grandfather, The Shaman Guy, The Ninja guy, The Silent Roomie, ( The last three were my roommates), The Yoga guy, The Beard Guy, The Brad Pitt Guy, The Sadistic Guy,
The Indian tech Guy, The Indian Blank Guy, The Brown Mustache Guy, The Harry Potter Guy, The FBI guy, The Yogi volunteer
I don&rsquo;t know why I put the word &ldquo;Guy&rdquo; behind everyone. So lets leave it.
Now let me explain why I named them so.
You pretty much understand a few, rest I&rsquo;ll explain. On the first day, The Shaman Guy was talking about something I didn&rsquo;t understand and in midst I hear this word Shaman and looked fancy cuz I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant.
The Ninja Guy: He was cutting bamboo and rest behind our dorms and making a stick to play with his fingers like a Ninja. I thought he was not serious in meditation at all from the very first moment.
The FBI guy: I contemplated for 10 days to uncover the secret behind the numbers pasted in his bottle. He looked gloomy at the beginning. Maybe, he is hiding right here.
The numbers were pasted by his brother and it was some kind of Japanese technique of wishing good to someone.
Oh my poor thoughts&hellip; They were into everything on a damn uncomfortable level.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anyone except two on this first day and now we are going to live together for 10 days without even talking with expressions.</p>
<p>Lets start the 10 days journey. You are experiencing a vivid journey of 10 days of meditation, so better take a long breath before we start.
I have one task for you. Wherever you feel like I am exaggerating something, increase the count. Let&rsquo;s see how much I can exaggerate this experience.</p>
<p>Day 1:
The time table is so strict to get up soon and start meditating all day. This is first day contemplating how shit I was to forget the soap and toothpaste. I was into it. I ate, I slept easy though. It was like easy meditation for the first day.
The meals I thought I would not survive out of it. There was no dinner and still need to wake up so early. I am quiet an early bird and I thought it was like back home:hungry when I woke up but it went quiet the opposite. The diet was actually
enough since we had no mechanical work except walk a few steps on the walking trail inside the center. But one thing was missing. We got a very good view of mountains and lake from there and it was usurped from us. Ugh&hellip; painful.
This was the best scene and they keep it restricted. It was a perfect place to meditate like the sagas of sages describes. It was the night I suffocated due to my blanket and felt horrible. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe for about a minute.
However, I felt asleep soon.</p>
<p>Day 2:
The nature was pretty amazing and from the dining seat, it was such a beautiful scenario. Today, a thorn was taken out. There came a slip in dining with a notice that if somebody wanted the supplies like soaps, toothpaste etc.
They could ask now and pay on the tenth day. A long sigh&hellip; A big relief for me. In the mornings and evenings, almost everyone was like standing on the trail looking at the last light when the day is finally going to be over.
Machhapuchre from the side and Annapurna: they were standing so peaceful. They were like soft from the inside and determined from the inside,stronger than everything. I was also worried if I get to take a good bath because the meal break
didn&rsquo;t use to be long. What if all went for the bathroom at the same time? I was worried about these little things that actually didn&rsquo;t make any difference in my life. This was the time I got to see a butterfly that I fell in love with.
It was matte black from inside and pretty oraange and yellow from outside. It had like two tails and it&rsquo;s movements were like those of a beautiful dancer on one of big stages. I tried hard to get it into my hand and see closely.
After waiting patiently for 30 minutes or so I got it. It was like achieving something great.</p>
<p>Day 3:
The meditational techniques were changing and I was trying to get my questions answered rather than the meditation itself. I would do for few moments the exercise they tell me to do then my mind would wander so fast. I was letting my mind
go wherever it wants because I thought how much thoughts could I possibly have when there&rsquo;s nothing happening new and you would pretty much contemplate everything. I had believed that in 4 or 5 days I would think so much that my over thinking thoughts would come to an end and I was just doing it. One funny thing I tried: I saw one of the guys walking bare footed. Just to look like a serious meditator, I also took off my slippers and walked around like I had attained some heavenly
Nirvana or something. Counting the end of 10 days was like: The 9th and 10th, a feeling that just one day will make everything easy. So 5 days more I was soothing myself.</p>
<p>Day 4:
This day, I looked at myself and thought I need to cut my beard off. If I cut it now, my face won&rsquo;t look like one of a child. I had tried partly on my previous year&rsquo;s vacation, so I knew it well. So, I thought to myself these people don&rsquo;t know me and also don&rsquo;t talk to me, so I will shave my beard this day. But as I said I had no razor or anything. So, I wrote for a razor on that day and waited for it to come. In the meantime, I&rsquo;d think like what would I do if they give me a Rs 5 blade and I cut my neck off. It took about 4 hours of that day&rsquo;s contemplation from time to time. It came again and again those pictures like I was cutting my throat and all. It was quiet disturbing to observe my reality from this point of time now. We were taught Vipasana this day and three hours of serious meditation as well. A lot of back pain, a lot and lot I tell you.</p>
<p>Day 5:
Now the meditation seems to be a bit deeper. Everyone seems to be more focused than they were before trying harder into it. The fear of razor was still haunting me in between. If I don&rsquo;t get a razor today I thought by the time I will be out, I will be like a kid, I feared.
Sometimes, I would get into meditation procedure quickly and be focused but sometimes it didn&rsquo;t focus at all. It was really true: I was a prisoner of my own mind. It became a lot clearer by this day.
The sedimentation and decantation of my thoughts was taking no seriousness, the thoughts do persist even now and I was amazed by the quantity. It was an endless river and I thought was never coming to an end.
Also, the body ached a lot. Everyone is doing some stretching or yoga. I am trying to copy some of them and it was fun. I think it&rsquo;s the day I saw the full moon so beautiful. There were webs all over trees and grass. The moon shining through
the thin fabric of spider&rsquo;s web, just imagine it yourself.</p>
<p>Day 6:
This day, I get a razor. Wow.. still 4 days left. Let&rsquo;s do it. They got me a good one. Fortunately,The memo of shave was short: I mean the cuts. :D Now I am a bit serious. I really felt like walking not just to be so but to feel the ground beneath me.
To feel everything that happens inside and outside me. I was looking at the mountains and they were getting more white each day, more beautiful each day. One more was a single boat in my entire view of lake. Everyone is quiet and into nature, more peaceful.</p>
<p>Day 7:
This was probably the best day I could remember. I got up at like 2. I didnt have a watch. Who keeps one on this age of cellphones, I thought. I realized I liked to have a watch now although I will have my phone when I am out.
I had a lucid dream that answered a few part of my questions I was searching for. Then, I went to meditate and focused for an hour or so. I suddenly get an amazing thought in between and was so much happy. I got out and walked around two rounds of the trail
without slippers. The cold was soothing my over-excitement of happiness and I knew I needed to be calm now as well. Now I was meditating well and suddenly I had a boner on the middle of meditation and changed my position to a comfortable one
:one like a super enjoying type. The volunteer came up to me to change the position while I think everyone was closing their eyes. I was red and shy. Oh man&hellip; I got it over in a hour. If I was out and experienced such a situation, I&rsquo;d feel like
shame for a maybe a week.</p>
<p>Day 8:
The previous day I was so much into meditation and enjoying myself as well. But starting this day was a bit difficult. I was asking myself questions and searching for answers rather than trying the meditational procedure. And in the daytime,
I glanced a volleyball match on the other side of the lake. I was looking from the spaces in between the branches of trees to get a view of what&rsquo;s on the other side. The bset part was to move here and there and create partial views to finally
understand the complete view of the other side. The moment &ldquo;The Ninja Guy&rdquo; left, one space in room made another one in my heart. I can leave as well since I have got what I was looking for. It was like some kind of loneliness and more of impatience.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 9:
This day was more like pain because three had left already and I couldn&rsquo;t concerntrate on myself. Now, The Yoga guy left. I felt he was serious towards this meditation but left. I felt kind of a despir within me. The clock was moving like a snail and my thoughts were trying to eat me back again. I was more peaceful than before but not as calm as I thought I had become.
My stomach still blurped when I thought of something I feared. The mountains and lake were quiet the motivation. Their calmness was the only helping key and later on I was meditating a bit better. One beautiful moment was my play with a butterfly with my long shadow.
I was kinda like an innocent and peaceful child. ;) The rest of the day went on with nothing special.</p>
<p>Day 10:
This day was out of my count for first 7 days. But, On the eighth, it came to be a big clock ticking like months to pass hours for last two days. But after the morning meditation, breakfast was served. That breakfast: the smell, the foods, the number of dishes on your seat Just Wow.
Everyone&rsquo;s face was sparkling so bright and smiling with themselves. I kinda glanced at someone and shared a smile because it was a big happiness considering my mind status for last two days. There were nine dishes for breakfast.
My tummy had no place for fruits. This was oh&hellip; imagine the most beautiful word you can get and fill the blanks.
It was on the 10th when I experienced something like heavenly with a particle like thing on my backbone. It was moving up and down and moves up to head and felt like a tree was growing in my brain. I was laughing with myself.
As a kid, when someone plays you to make you laugh and ask to stop, it was somehow similar. This was just a unexpected sensation and nothing more but beautiful.
Now it was the talking time at 10. As my friend had told he was like silent for a month after return but I was jolly, too eager to get enlightened by their experiences.
When we started talking, there was no stop to it. The view was mesmerizing all around, the expressions of happiness and it was certainly heavenly. Now I get to know them on a deeper level. We talked all along although we had meditation sessions in between.
So much talking&hellip; whoo. The Shaman guy was the boss of a textile industry and his story was amazing. He had meditational blocks made by Nike. Nike WTF? Yeah Nike even made these. I saw a lot of equipments used for making meditations easy, I didnt even know these existed.
Earning money and owning something was quiet different from what I thought. He wanted to get out off his own company at that time and this whole trip without asking for a leave was a sign for them to understand it, he said.
There was a guy who left an IT company he started and walked around without a thought of what he might be at his country back. During the meditation days, I felt as if he had big trouble. On this day, I came to knew all about his company but he seemed less troubled now.
I talked a lot and lot, might-be most talked to him after the Indian one. It not only was peace for him to share but for me as well. Somethings resonated to my thoughts and taught me something precious.
Their professions Biomedical Engineers, System Design at Cisco, Entrepreneurs and all. The difference between us and them is that they work a lot when they need to. I think I was the youngest of the group, so I experienced so much of life from around the world in those 10 days.
Maybe, it will take me even 40 years to travel 4 or 5 countries as per the current scenario. So, it was quiet mesmerizing.</p>
<p>The journey ended in the morning of 11th day 7 am.</p>
<p>The experience I shared is mostly the outwards experience. I cannot share in words what I truly felt from the inside. As you can Google for things like DMT trips and all, it was kind of one. I always rushed away from my thoughts, it was
the first time I just observed them. Everyone speaks of not being able to control themselves but most of us don&rsquo;t even want to give a try. A try to tame your wild bull, a try to think things from some different perspective than you
usually live in and mostly to experience something amazing everyone felt who have been to Vipasana. I have found quiet unlikely that people express this ten days meditation as a waste of time because those who experienced it are quiet
eager to speak and motivate others to go to it. It means it&rsquo;s something different. Quiet out from religious dogmas, it is quiet more like a dissection of yourself by yourself. So, in a belief that I could ask more of you to experience
the thing I experienced, to be able to hear more stories and motivate each others to continue this practise. We have a facility even free of cost which says by itself that Volunteering is the greatest donation rather than money and expects
your happiness in return for the 10 days experience, why not give it a try.
The outwards experience and learning as mine might differ from place you choose to go to meditate but the internal feelings of happiness will pretty much be same. If you like it, share it. Share your experiences as well. I will be more than happy to hear of your wonderful feelings.
Ask others to join you when you complete one. Let&rsquo;s try what we have at our own doorsteps by taking 10 days out our hectic life not for someone else but for own self. If you cannot find 10 days, go for shorter ones or simply go and have a seat in one of those. You are most likely to feel a different vibration because of the place they have set up just by volunteering. If you think I have exaggerated, I haven&rsquo;t. You can give a fair try to it in many Vipasana centers across the country. I want to thank Vipasana center, my friends during the meditation, management and everyone heartfully for providing me this amazing experience to share with you all. Thank you all for going through this long writing patiently as well.</p>
<p>May all be happy and peaceful. Bhawatu Saba Mangala.:)</p>

समेटिएको यो जीवनमा
च्यातिएका ती पानाहरु
स्वयमहित्को तान्डवसँगै
कुल्चिएका भावनाहरु ।

धुँवा बनी उडेको छ
संसार जस्तो भएपनि

हिमालका ती कोप्चारामा
हिउँसँगै जमेकोछ ।।
