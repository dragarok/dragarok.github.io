            <description>Inside the dark vents of my body,
Lies the vines: of growing darkness.
Trying to find it&amp;rsquo;s way to my brain,
It sweeps, explodes
It grunges from the inside.
There used to be garden inside,
Thoughts laid peace within me.
Fights were always physical then,
Peace was a habit,
And thoughts resembled curiosity then.
The darkness grew out of the worldly ways,
The stories of success,
The stories of failures,</description>

<p>Lies the vines: of growing darkness.</p>
<p>Trying to find it&rsquo;s way to my brain,</p>
<p>It sweeps, explodes</p>
<p>It grunges from the inside.</p>
<p>There used to be garden inside,</p>
<p>Thoughts laid peace within me.</p>
<p>Fights were always physical then,</p>
<p>Peace was a habit,</p>
<p>And thoughts resembled curiosity then.</p>
<p>The darkness grew out of the worldly ways,</p>
<p>The stories of success,</p>
<p>The stories of failures,</p>
<p>The horrors of living,</p>
<p>The ephemeral life,</p>
<p>And the drive to thrive.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>With a gasp it starts,</p>
<p>Slowly it finds it&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>Creepy they are,</p>
<p>Creeping through me like swinging vines,</p>
<p>Stranded and clogged.</p>
<p>Walls of mind and tentacles of thoughts,</p>
<p>The war of the microcosm,</p>
<p>The dance of the devil form.</p>
<p>My bones are still the same,</p>
<p>My muscles undeformed,</p>
<p>But it feels like</p>
<p>The quarks inside them want some deadly transform.</p>
<p>Cold it is,</p>
<p>To fight with ownself.</p>
<p>Hard it is,</p>
<p>To break the chains of thoughts.</p>
<p>Pain it is,</p>
<p>To not understand anyone but ownself.</p>
<p>Peace it is,</p>
<p>To lay inside the box in peace</p>
<p>With tentacles of thoughts buried to the ground.</p>

            <description>Peak they saw,
Thought they made,
Of the day when their steps would be on the mountain peak,
Clear seem&amp;rsquo;d they, Of the goal they desperately seek.
Guided by the river trail,
Dreams flew high against the flow,
The mountains of hope: deep and strong first,
Now saw the wind of fear that slowly blow.
The path feels rough now,
The silent howls of people&amp;rsquo;s voice he heard,
Of those who got lost on that way,</description>

<p>Creeping from the inside out,</p>
<p>Growls the wolf wishing to devour his vow.</p>
