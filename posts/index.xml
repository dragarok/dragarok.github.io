<li>Mindfulness
<ul>
<li>Knowing what you are thinking of and what is happening internally will help
you understand how irrational thoughts surface and develop with time.</li>
<li>To help with thought interruptions, keep a timer, rubber band or something
that constantly stays with you and add it to your lifestyle purposefully
for that mental activity interruption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gratitude
<ul>
<li>Feel good for all the small yet beautiful things in life. This helps build
positive hormones in the brain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Challenge irrationalities
<ul>
<li>When you find yourself nagging without any evidence, challenge yourself to
find evidences for it. Bring logic and rationality to the picture; will
help you realize the futility of a thought drain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditate
<ul>
<li>Any way of meditation is helpful for your mind since it&rsquo;s the time you
accept to recognize yourself without subconsciously living a life and
accepting everything that&rsquo;s out there. It will help you get insights, be
more peaceful as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visualization
<ul>
<li>Visualization are amazing tools of positive affirmations. If you can
imagine yourself doing and believe it, it will help you attract that
effect. Imagine yourself being confident just like a mantra to repeat at
certain times. This will push yourself to work as well.</li>

 Even before starting, the mental pressure of the whole big hill over you makes you more afraid even to start. You try to console yourself that you can do it in some later point as you don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy to do it now or some reason to justify not to do it now.</description>

<h3 id="problem-1-immensity-of-work">Problem 1: Immensity of work</h3>
<ul>
<li>You commit to wiping out an entire forest instead of actually starting to
work with a single tree at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Even before starting, the mental pressure of the whole big hill over you makes
you more afraid even to start. You try to console yourself that you can do it
in some later point as you don&rsquo;t have the energy to do it now or some reason
to justify not to do it now. The immensity makes it difficult even after days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>Break down a big task into as simple tasks as possible. Like breaking down a
big rock into pebbles. The pebbles should be as simple as they can be such as
setting up your environment and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-2-fear-of-actual-results">Problem 2: Fear of actual results</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to get gratification by saying: &ldquo;I could have done that amazing task
and I know I would be great at it&rdquo;. You are taking this mental gratification
as a justification for not doing the task at hand. Remember: <strong>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t edit
a blank page.&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>If you think people will judge you for your results and you think it will make
you feel bad. In fact, people don&rsquo;t even care for most of us. Just because you
have over 1000 friends on Facebook, hundreds of followers on Instagram doesn&rsquo;t
mean they are interested in you. People aren&rsquo;t computers. Even the strongest
of memories fade away: People have to have a grudge on you to remember small
things that you failed even if you failed small. Will you care about them and
not work?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-3-jumbled-physical-spaces">Problem 3: Jumbled physical spaces</h3>
<ul>
<li>You watch movie, read and sleep on the same bed.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>You have no specific place that you can work on so that sitting on the space
itself helps you commit to work you put off for a long time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution     :ATTACH:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your mind&rsquo;s accustomed to working things as automatically as you can.
Creative people, players and even commonly us: We do things unconsciously upon
being in different kinds of environment. Your brain&rsquo;s amazing and does tasks
on it&rsquo;s own as much as it can. But these automatic tasks might not be
favorable at instances. Your body understands to feel drowsy and sleepy when
in bed; So when you feel like being the most productive person on the planet
in your bed, your brain fails you miserably.</p>
<p>So, instead of quarreling with the hundreds of years of evolution, take it to
your advantage. If you separate spaces for your work, sleep and rest; now this
habit of brain helps you to work when you are at physical space representing
work: either it&rsquo;s simple table and chair for you or an entire study room.</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-4-no-actionable-tasks">Problem 4: No actionable tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even your planned tasks are vague and need more thinking.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Your tasks need thinking even after you made the plan. Now you drown down the
rabbit hole and the whole loop starts again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ol>
<li>Two minute rule: Tasks that take two minutes now: just slash them out of your
list. Your list is precious and needs to be as clean as possible. These two
minutes task if ignored for now might take longer later on.</li>
<li>Make tasks actionable: Don&rsquo;t drown into thoughts again : I will do this or
that and all of it. Make simple tasks that you can clearly see yourself
working and start doing it.</li>
<li>Start with something that you find best in that whole rock: a simple crystal
you like. It might not be the first thing to do but to keep you on track and
inspire you: it will be the best place to start.</li>
<li>Plan tasks with actual schedule. Don&rsquo;t even think of situations where you can
compromise later. What if someone calls me for party? This is the worst
thing you can do now. What happens and what to be done if such thing happens
is to be taken care of at that very moment it happens. Don&rsquo;t ever fall into
that trap.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-5-you-are-a-perfectionist">Problem 5: You are a perfectionist</h3>
<ul>
<li>You feel like you have to be the best out there and shouldn&rsquo;t do something
that&rsquo;s not amazing.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a perfectionist but realist at the same time helps but just making
perfect imaginations of anything doesn&rsquo;t help at all. Learn the art of the
start. Be relentless to perfection but for god&rsquo;s sake start with any output
you can have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>We all want to have the best versions of ourselves to show to others. Noone
wants to be seen weak or incapable. But it&rsquo;s people who start with anything
they have, improvise over time are the ones who accomplish the most. It&rsquo;s okay
to be afraid because it&rsquo;s deep rooted in our brain from earlier times of
evolution. It&rsquo;s a social coping mechanism. People who weren&rsquo;t accepted by
society back in hunting days would die or be killed. We have changed but our
brains are wired the same way. Don&rsquo;t stress over it. Just give time to see
people doing imperfect things. You can start by looking at works of your
favorite YouTubers and movie stars so that you know people you thought are
perfect now were not perfect from the very start. They improvised over time to
be who they are now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-6-tasks-that-need-internet">Problem 6: Tasks that need Internet</h3>
<ul>
<li>You start working with all your enthusiasm when a certain notification bell
rings on your phone or you start with 10 minutes of Facebook time.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>You get lost searching for things on the internet related to your task and
find at the end of the day that you spent a whole day watching YouTube videos
and browsing Facebook or Reddit or anything you hadn&rsquo;t planned for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>In today&rsquo;s time, most of us can&rsquo;t work without using internet. While all the
media companies and businesses over internet are there to lure you to spend
more time on their platform, it&rsquo;s a very hard escape out of it. They have been
studying our psychologies and preferences even those which we are not even
conscious of. So, the best thing we can do is be aware. Be present at the
moment. Have a stopwatch tick before you start using Internet or regular
interval checks to at least know when you have plunged into it.
Doing this simple act will change you over time. It&rsquo;s not an overnight thing
but it will create some significant changes.</li>
<li>Use site blockers: the stricter the better. Some cannot even be uninstalled
after you activate them. Make sure to make it as difficult  as possible to
stop them. e.g. Trigger stopping it to deleting all your movies and music from
your hard drive. Just giving some ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="few-last-tips">Few Last Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use Pomodoro technique if you like it. It helps make tasks look simple in
terms of time to commit to tasks.</li>
<li>Use your morning to give a momentum for the day. Just accomplishing simple
tasks as folding your bed or cleaning up your room can give you a feeling of
gratitude and push you to break some more rocks ahead.</li>
<li>Getting Things Done is a nice way to organize your todo lists.</li>
<li>Try to make a weekly review of your todo list so that you know what are
blocking you. You can do shorter reviews such as in 3 days. The faster the
review time: the better the feedback loop. You know your problems better.</li>
</ul>

            <description>A Reminiscence   Looking at this image, I find it funny how we change so much that we are no longer ourselves. I believed I was this way for as long as I can remember but alas with time: memories fade, people around you change and you no longer are the same person that you were before. This is the first page of my diary I made in my 9th grade.</description>

<p>Looking at this image, I find it funny how we change so much that we are no
longer ourselves. I believed I was this way for as long as I can remember but
alas with time: memories fade, people around you change and you no longer are
the same person that you were before.
This is the first page of my diary I made in my 9th grade.
Looking at the aim I wrote in this diary, it feels so funny and grave misfortune
that I had no idea about the storm of life that was about to burst upon me with
all it&rsquo;s might. I so foolishly believed life was all about being the best in
exams. There&rsquo;s a catch here though: the people I was around, the people who
wanted me to have a bright successful life always came to me and said it: maybe
thousand times or more. My teachers, my parents, my relatives and everyone that
wished well for me.
Either they didn&rsquo;t know that life was so intricate and complex beyond you
passing exams and being best out of it. I believed it to be the holy grail that
would guide my life now.</p>
<p>Now, Walking along this path, I did what I believed. I became the best version
of who I could be with what I had. Then the wind hit me hard in my face as I
faced the winding road of life. There was no simple aim in anyone&rsquo;s life. I was
with my shield of <strong>being best in exams</strong> and in real life I was as naked as I
could be. Now, the arrows hit me from all sides: arrows being just education and
certificate doesn&rsquo;t make you who you want to be. Life told me: You need to learn
some life skills: hobbies that you can do when you are in pain so that you get
lost in yourself, skills that you can at least earn some money for your
expenses, ability to ask for what you want when you realize the world doesn&rsquo;t give a
damn about you and the fact that you have to go exploring the world rather than
success and happiness coming to you by default.</p>
<p>The quote I wrote there seems amazing to me since myself in that state was all
clear about his life and his path. Yet, that me knew what was going to happen
with my life. For all these years, this quote has been the summary of my life. I
feared ever trying to give 100% to anything. I always left when I felt it was
finally up to the top. I felt an urge to back down when I saw the peak. It was
never that I didn&rsquo;t have the knowledge or the skills I needed, it was just I was
afraid of falling on the way to the mountaintop.
All this has come to me after 8 years. I wished I could write this letter to
that me 8 years back.Would it have mattered? Would I have listened to myself? That&rsquo;s a
question that will forever remain.</p>
<p>I have gone through a horrible path to get out of this belief. I hope no child
is taught that exams are the way to better life: life is much more than that. I
hope noone has to go this long to realize their beliefs were a lie.</p>

            <description>Inside the dark vents of my body,
Lies the vines: of growing darkness.
Trying to find it&amp;rsquo;s way to my brain,
It sweeps, explodes
It grunges from the inside.
 There used to be garden inside,
Thoughts laid peace within me.
Fights were always physical then,
Peace was a habit,
And thoughts resembled curiosity then.
 The darkness grew out of the worldly ways,
The stories of success,
The stories of failures,</description>

<p>Now,</p>
<p>With a gasp it starts,</p>
<p>Slowly it finds it&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>Creepy they are,</p>
<p>Creeping through me like swinging vines,</p>
<p>Stranded and clogged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walls of mind and tentacles of thoughts,</p>
<p>The war of the microcosm,</p>
<p>The dance of the devil form.</p>
<p>My bones are still the same,</p>
<p>My muscles undeformed,</p>
<p>But it feels like</p>
<p>The quarks inside them want some deadly transform.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cold it is,</p>
<p>To fight with ownself.</p>
<p>Hard it is,</p>
<p>To break the chains of thoughts.</p>
<p>Pain it is,</p>
<p>To not understand anyone but ownself.</p>
<p>Peace it is,</p>
<p>To lay inside the box in peace</p>
<p>With tentacles of thoughts buried to the ground.</p>

            <description>Peak they saw,
Thought they made,
Of the day when their steps would be on the mountain peak,
Clear seem&amp;rsquo;d they, Of the goal they desperately seek.
 Guided by the river trail,
Dreams flew high against the flow,
The mountains of hope: deep and strong first,
Now saw the wind of fear that slowly blow.
 The path feels rough now,
The silent howls of people&amp;rsquo;s voice he heard,</description>

<p><strong>His heart</strong> gets cold,</p>
<p>The body gets blue,</p>
<p>Creeping from the inside out,</p>
<p>Growls the wolf wishing to devour his vow.</p>

            <description>आकाङ्क्षाका पानाहरुमा
समेटिएको यो जीवनमा
च्यातिएका ती पानाहरु
स्वयमहित्को तान्डवसँगै
कुल्चिएका भावनाहरु ।
तिनै जलेका पानाहरु
धुँवा बनी उडेको छ
संसार जस्तो भएपनि
अदृश्यतामा रमेकोछ ।
हिमालका ती कोप्चारामा
हिउँसँगै जमेकोछ ।।
 सुरको धुनमा बज्दा यसलाई
शब्दकोशमा खोजेपछि
आफुलाई नचाहरि
धर्मग्रन्थ रटेपछि
न्यायका ती किताबले नै
सत्यतालाई ढाकेपछि ।
सत्य आज मरिसक्यो
जीवनलाई छाडेपछि
मृत्यु सत्य बनिसक्यो
सत्य खोज्न थालेपछि ।।
 गढिमाईको मन्दीरमा
मृत्यु नै त सत्य बन्यो</description>

यो माटोलाई त्यागिसक्यो<br>
विनाशतिर लम्काएर<br>
संसारदेखि भागिसक्यो ।।</p>
