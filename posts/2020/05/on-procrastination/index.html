<h3 id="problem-1-immensity-of-work">Problem 1: Immensity of work</h3>
<ul>
<li>You commit to wiping out an entire forest instead of actually starting to
work with a single tree at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Even before starting, the mental pressure of the whole big hill over you makes
you more afraid even to start. You try to console yourself that you can do it
in some later point as you don&rsquo;t have the energy to do it now or some reason
to justify not to do it now. The immensity makes it difficult even after days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>Break down a big task into as simple tasks as possible. Like breaking down a
big rock into pebbles. The pebbles should be as simple as they can be such as
setting up your environment and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-2-fear-of-actual-results">Problem 2: Fear of actual results</h3>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to get gratification by saying: &ldquo;I could have done that amazing task
and I know I would be great at it&rdquo;. You are taking this mental gratification
as a justification for not doing the task at hand. Remember: <strong>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t edit
a blank page.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>If you think people will judge you for your results and you think it will make
you feel bad. In fact, people don&rsquo;t even care for most of us. Just because you
have over 1000 friends on Facebook, hundreds of followers on Instagram doesn&rsquo;t
mean they are interested in you. People aren&rsquo;t computers. Even the strongest
of memories fade away: People have to have a grudge on you to remember small
things that you failed even if you failed small. Will you care about them and
not work?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-3-jumbled-physical-spaces">Problem 3: Jumbled physical spaces</h3>
<ul>
<li>You watch movie, read and sleep on the same bed.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>You have no specific place that you can work on so that sitting on the space
itself helps you commit to work you put off for a long time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution     :ATTACH:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your mind&rsquo;s accustomed to working things as automatically as you can.
Creative people, players and even commonly us: We do things unconsciously upon
being in different kinds of environment. Your brain&rsquo;s amazing and does tasks
on it&rsquo;s own as much as it can. But these automatic tasks might not be
favorable at instances. Your body understands to feel drowsy and sleepy when
in bed; So when you feel like being the most productive person on the planet
in your bed, your brain fails you miserably.</p>
<p>So, instead of quarreling with the hundreds of years of evolution, take it to
your advantage. If you separate spaces for your work, sleep and rest; now this
habit of brain helps you to work when you are at physical space representing
work: either it&rsquo;s simple table and chair for you or an entire study room.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    </figure>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-4-no-actionable-tasks">Problem 4: No actionable tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even your planned tasks are vague and need more thinking.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Your tasks need thinking even after you made the plan. Now you drown down the
rabbit hole and the whole loop starts again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ol>
<li>Two minute rule: Tasks that take two minutes now: just slash them out of your
list. Your list is precious and needs to be as clean as possible. These two
minutes task if ignored for now might take longer later on.</li>
<li>Make tasks actionable: Don&rsquo;t drown into thoughts again : I will do this or
that and all of it. Make simple tasks that you can clearly see yourself
working and start doing it.</li>
<li>Start with something that you find best in that whole rock: a simple crystal
you like. It might not be the first thing to do but to keep you on track and
inspire you: it will be the best place to start.</li>
<li>Plan tasks with actual schedule. Don&rsquo;t even think of situations where you can
compromise later. What if someone calls me for party? This is the worst
thing you can do now. What happens and what to be done if such thing happens
is to be taken care of at that very moment it happens. Don&rsquo;t ever fall into
that trap.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-5-you-are-a-perfectionist">Problem 5: You are a perfectionist</h3>
<ul>
<li>You feel like you have to be the best out there and shouldn&rsquo;t do something
that&rsquo;s not amazing.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a perfectionist but realist at the same time helps but just making
perfect imaginations of anything doesn&rsquo;t help at all. Learn the art of the
start. Be relentless to perfection but for god&rsquo;s sake start with any output
you can have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>We all want to have the best versions of ourselves to show to others. Noone
wants to be seen weak or incapable. But it&rsquo;s people who start with anything
they have, improvise over time are the ones who accomplish the most. It&rsquo;s okay
to be afraid because it&rsquo;s deep rooted in our brain from earlier times of
evolution. It&rsquo;s a social coping mechanism. People who weren&rsquo;t accepted by
society back in hunting days would die or be killed. We have changed but our
brains are wired the same way. Don&rsquo;t stress over it. Just give time to see
people doing imperfect things. You can start by looking at works of your
favorite YouTubers and movie stars so that you know people you thought are
perfect now were not perfect from the very start. They improvised over time to
be who they are now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-6-tasks-that-need-internet">Problem 6: Tasks that need Internet</h3>
<ul>
<li>You start working with all your enthusiasm when a certain notification bell
rings on your phone or you start with 10 minutes of Facebook time.</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>You get lost searching for things on the internet related to your task and
find at the end of the day that you spent a whole day watching YouTube videos
and browsing Facebook or Reddit or anything you hadn&rsquo;t planned for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>In today&rsquo;s time, most of us can&rsquo;t work without using internet. While all the
media companies and businesses over internet are there to lure you to spend
more time on their platform, it&rsquo;s a very hard escape out of it. They have been
studying our psychologies and preferences even those which we are not even
conscious of. So, the best thing we can do is be aware. Be present at the
moment. Have a stopwatch tick before you start using Internet or regular
interval checks to at least know when you have plunged into it.
Doing this simple act will change you over time. It&rsquo;s not an overnight thing
but it will create some significant changes.</li>
<li>Use site blockers: the stricter the better. Some cannot even be uninstalled
after you activate them. Make sure to make it as difficult  as possible to
stop them. e.g. Trigger stopping it to deleting all your movies and music from
your hard drive. Just giving some ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="few-last-tips">Few Last Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use Pomodoro technique if you like it. It helps make tasks look simple in
terms of time to commit to tasks.</li>
<li>Use your morning to give a momentum for the day. Just accomplishing simple
tasks as folding your bed or cleaning up your room can give you a feeling of
gratitude and push you to break some more rocks ahead.</li>
<li>Getting Things Done is a nice way to organize your todo lists.</li>
<li>Try to make a weekly review of your todo list so that you know what are
blocking you. You can do shorter reviews such as in 3 days. The faster the
review time: the better the feedback loop. You know your problems better.</li>
</ul>
