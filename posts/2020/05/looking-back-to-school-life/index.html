<p>Looking at this image, I find it funny how we change so much that we are no
longer ourselves. I believed I was this way for as long as I can remember but
alas with time: memories fade, people around you change and you no longer are
the same person that you were before.
This is the first page of my diary I made in my 9th grade.
Looking at the aim I wrote in this diary, it feels so funny and grave misfortune
that I had no idea about the storm of life that was about to burst upon me with
all it&rsquo;s might. I so foolishly believed life was all about being the best in
exams. There&rsquo;s a catch here though: the people I was around, the people who
wanted me to have a bright successful life always came to me and said it: maybe
thousand times or more. My teachers, my parents, my relatives and everyone that
wished well for me.
Either they didn&rsquo;t know that life was so intricate and complex beyond you
passing exams and being best out of it. I believed it to be the holy grail that
would guide my life now.</p>
<p>Now, Walking along this path, I did what I believed. I became the best version
of who I could be with what I had. Then the wind hit me hard in my face as I
faced the winding road of life. There was no simple aim in anyone&rsquo;s life. I was
with my shield of <strong>being best in exams</strong> and in real life I was as naked as I
could be. Now, the arrows hit me from all sides: arrows being just education and
certificate doesn&rsquo;t make you who you want to be. Life told me: You need to learn
some life skills: hobbies that you can do when you are in pain so that you get
lost in yourself, skills that you can at least earn some money for your
expenses, ability to ask for what you want when you realize the world doesn&rsquo;t give a
damn about you and the fact that you have to go exploring the world rather than
success and happiness coming to you by default.</p>
<p>The quote I wrote there seems amazing to me since myself in that state was all
clear about his life and his path. Yet, that me knew what was going to happen
with my life. For all these years, this quote has been the summary of my life. I
feared ever trying to give 100% to anything. I always left when I felt it was
finally up to the top. I felt an urge to back down when I saw the peak. It was
never that I didn&rsquo;t have the knowledge or the skills I needed, it was just I was
afraid of falling on the way to the mountaintop.
All this has come to me after 8 years. I wished I could write this letter to
that me 8 years back.Would it have mattered? Would I have listened to myself? That&rsquo;s a
question that will forever remain.</p>
<p>I have gone through a horrible path to get out of this belief. I hope no child
is taught that exams are the way to better life: life is much more than that. I
hope noone has to go this long to realize their beliefs were a lie.</p>
