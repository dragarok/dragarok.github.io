            <div class="post-content">
                <p>First I was innocent,</br>
I asked for an identity,</br>
The world pushed me down and pained me.</br>
I talked to the world about this pain,</br>
And the world mocked me.</br></p>
</br>
I felt alone in this fight,</br>
I wanted to run away.</br>
But, she didn't let me.</br>
She made me break into a thousand pieces,</br>
But always took great care that none was lost.</br>
And when I gave up,</br>
She made me work on myself.</br>
And That's how I recollected myself to be wholler than the whole.</br>
</br>
</br>
-------------------------------xx-------------------------------
</br>
</br>
</br>
Second I was in limelight,</br>
I asked for strength,</br>
Then the eyes of the world fixated at me pained me.</br>
Their dreams, their expectations,</br>
Them trying to fulfill their dreams through me.</br>
I again talked to the world about the burden of expectations,</br>
And the world really didn't care.</br>
<br>
I felt alone again in this fight,</br>
I wanted to run away.</br>
But, she didn't let me.</br>
She made me take even more burden until I broke again,</br>
Yet she took great care again that none was lost.</br>
And when I gave up,</br>
She made me work on myself.</br>
And That's how I recollected myself to be wholler than the whole again.</br>
</br>
</br>
-------------------------------xx-------------------------------
</br>
</br>
</br>
<p>Third, I was now strong enough to take any burden.</br>
I asked for truth,</br>
I started wandering here and there in search of truth,</br>
The words from thousand masters buzzed like a bomb inside my head.</br>
But by now, I knew the world never listened.</br>
So I chose a few I was hoping would listen without judgement,</br>
Tried telling them about the never ending search,</br>
Yet they too didn&rsquo;t get much.</br></p></p>
</br>
</br>
I was feeling utterly alone by then,</br>
I wanted to run away.</br>
But, she didn't let me.</br>
I had to sit there with thousand petals opening inside me,</br>
Yet not even an eye to appreciate.</br>
I wanted to help those few to make it bloom in them,</br>
Yet each one had their own doubts.</br>
</br>
</br>
<p>The petals bloomed, </br>
The petals faded,</br>
And they fell back to the ground.</br>
Forgetting the fact that it is the nature of petals to fall off,</br>
I started crying seeing all those petals within withering away,</br>
Yet she took great care to collect them all for me.</br>
And when I gave up crying,</br>
She held my hand,</br>
She reached out to me with the incense she prepared from those flowers,</br>
And That&rsquo;s how I recollected myself to be wholler than the whole again.</br></p></p>
</br>
</br>
-------------------------------xx-------------------------------
</br>
</br>
</br>
Fourth, I realized myself and my relationship with her.</br>
Through her eyes,</br>
I realized the world too was her all along.</br>
Now, I was no longer bashing my head,</br>
Neither was I trying to make the world understand me.</br>
I was happy with the fragrance she left me with.</br>
</br>
</br>
One day, I realized she had been with me the whole time,</br>
And then,
I no longer needed to run away.</br>
I no longer needed to say anything to the world,</br>
Or hear back something from there.</br>
I no longer was bashing my head.</br>
I was just there lost in the fragrance of the flowers,</br>
And she came.</br>
She asked me to not get lost in that fragrance,</br>
And gave me keys to her garden itself.</br>
</br>
</br>
Now, I sit there smiling like a madman. ☺️ </br>
