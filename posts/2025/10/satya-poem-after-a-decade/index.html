            <div class="post-content">
                <p>The context is this: I wrote this poem as an extension of my emotions 10 years ago.
The poem&rsquo;s titled &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; and was the first poem on my blog.</p>
<p>Neither am I a poet, nor a storyteller. I wrote what I genuinely felt at that time. And this was close to when Gadhimai Mela was about to happen and there was a lot of news about <strong>Bali Pratha</strong> needing to stop and so on. It triggered something that was already brewing inside me vehemently, into words. This is my commentary on my own writing after 10 years of seeking, learning, and coming home.</p>
<p>I will explain each paragraph one by one: what still is true, what I have learned that I didn&rsquo;t a decade ago, and so on. This will probably be a long one, but a worthy one if you genuinely are looking for yourself too. And I don&rsquo;t think I will write much on Spirituality from now on because my path is laid somewhere else. And there is more than enough written out there for an ardent seeker already.</p>
<p>I am just enjoying living. If you have questions, you can personally ask me. No time for arguments, all the time for those who truly need it. Apart from that, I hope you find peace within you. I bow down to the divinity in all of you. Lets get started here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>आकाङ्क्षाका पानाहरुमा </br>
समेटिएको यो जीवनमा</br>
च्यातिएका ती पानाहरु</br>
स्वयमहित्को तान्डवसँगै</br>
कुल्चिएका भावनाहरु ।</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wise ones say the Universe was born out of desire: a desire to find itself, know itself, know its limits. And so it does create these projections to understand what it can be. And that&rsquo;s life summarized as well. And its true that each individual is fragmented, and torn; not because of themselves but by design. The same design that can recognize it as whole too. It&rsquo;s just you who is unable to recognize this whole. To this, there is this Sanskrit quote that summarizes what you might not have known:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते ।</br>
पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥</br>
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning: This is complete, that is complete. From this whole, that whole arises.</br>
When you take this whole out of that, it&rsquo;s indeed complete yet again.
Peace, Peace, Peace.</br></p>
<p>This is the idea. You don&rsquo;t think that is possible because you didn&rsquo;t assume the nature of this primordial whole which is uncaused. Just by being uncaused, its not graspable by logic. We understand linearity and causality pretty easily. You already know how brain fuck time travel movies can be. Think of it like that. </br>
Think about the first thing that existed and how. Contemplate, introspect, and study at the same time. Whatever answer there is, it will find you.</br></p>
<p>So, coming to this, we who live our lives in misery, are these torn pages. This is not me saying it. This is Buddha saying &ldquo;Life is misery&rdquo;. And to why, everyone says its because you live too tight with your ego. Anything and everything hurts you. Your intuition, your emotions are bulldozered by someone else all the time. That&rsquo;s why it is indeed miserable in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>तिनै जलेका पानाहरु</br>
धुँवा बनी उडेको छ</br>
संसार जस्तो भएपनि</br>
अदृश्यतामा रमेकोछ ।</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the smell of misery is everywhere. The burnt smell is flowing here and there. We are all emitting that smell, and its almost as if it has engulfed the whole atmosphere. And where is the fragrance? The fragrance is hiding itself in the safest position away from the burnt smell: as fire that burns it.
The smell of burning comes because you know there is somewhere fire that is burning. And that fire is your inner recognition: your inner peace lying within you. The smell that&rsquo;s reaching your nose is telling you to look for that inner fire which has hidden itself but the symptom of that fire is that smell of burning itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>हिमालका ती कोप्चारामा</br>
हिउँसँगै जमेकोछ ।।</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, its frozen right there. Its not moving. Its still hiding behind that stiffness in all of us.</br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>सुरको धुनमा बज्दा यसलाई</br>
शब्दकोशमा खोजेपछि</br>
आफुलाई नचाहरि</br>
धर्मग्रन्थ रटेपछि</br>
न्यायका ती किताबले नै</br>
सत्यतालाई ढाकेपछि ।</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of these things one would say out of anger too. Beautiful words, but I didn&rsquo;t know anything at that time. It just was written through my being. Neither did I know scriptures, nor did I know where the music was.</br></p>
<p>Its heavily true that you try to find words to expressions that you cannot understand. Like the origin of universe, there are things which logic can&rsquo;t hold much longer, but your being knows exactly what its talking about.</br></p>
<p>If we both have experienced Love, we both understand a lover looking at the moon and appreciating the moon as their lovers. Or them looking at lover&rsquo;s eyes and comparing it to the moon. We both didn&rsquo;t communicate in words. We communicated in that imperfect expression of love which is pointing to the feeling that we understood in ourselves. </br></p>
<p>That is the same with inner Truth. It can&rsquo;t be expressed in all these words I say. Even Rabindranath Tagore was not able to do it in Gitanjali. But when I read him, I see the same fragrance. Being which has touched the source at least, and wants to get engrossed in it.</br></p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world, not enough people are reading scriptures, yet claiming facts by taking one line/page, and making judgements about it. The wise ones have found Truth in all of them, because the Truth is right there in all of us.</br></p>
<p>How can it not be in one of the best expressions of us? If you don&rsquo;t have time to study, better stay away from it. If you want to comment, better study. Just imagine a 12 year old coming at Scientific Literature with 8th grader knowledge. A lot of things in his book were written to simplify it for that 12 year old, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean its not true, or its not representing Truth.</br></p>
<p>This is not me saying I know it, but this is the pattern that I have unraveled within these books. I have recognized a few lines, and these are enough pointers for a bigger mystery. </br>
Science is one of the best portals to Truth. If you want to negate religion and scriptures, accept Science as the only Truth. It will take you to your being faster than almost all of those who follow religion. </br></p>
<p>But, if you already are a skeptic, find your own boxes to put reasoning and your spirituality into. Find contradictions. Don&rsquo;t open these boxes when you need them just to win arguments. Soon enough, they will start talking to you. You need to give ideas time to settle.</br></p>
<p>Law, order, society, rituals, traditions, ideas etc. There is bit of truth in all of that but someone will disagree to it all the time. Its an attempt to localize answer for easing our lives. So, understand most of it as that.</br></p>
<p>Just focus on finding something that is not localized; something that doesn&rsquo;t change if I put you in Nepal or US or Japan. That will be a good pointer for finding ideas that are universal. That is one good anchor to walk the walk.</br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>सत्य आज मरिसक्यो</br>
जीवनलाई छाडेपछि</br>
मृत्यु सत्य बनिसक्यो</br>
सत्य खोज्न थालेपछि ।।</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haha, this is one of the funniest things about life. There is one simple truth that I can tell you as well.
<strong>&ldquo;To this day, everybody who has lived, has died, sooner or later.&rdquo;</strong>
Death is simply washing away of all there is. But even Buddha believed in reincarnation.</br>
Finding escape in death is easy, but only if it sure could be an escape.
Life is meant to be lived with such vigor and ecstasy knowing its going to come to an end eventually.</br>
Buddhist monks draw a Mandala out of sand, putting in all the effort for weeks for it to look flawless, only to wipe it off after completing it. That is not silly. That is a practice that gets closer to life than anything else. Just because we know that its going to extinguish doesn&rsquo;t mean we are stopped from creating beauty. We can create beauty with an understanding that it will perish.</br></p>
<p>When we create beauty with that idea, beauty stands by itself: glorious.</br>
And the way to live life is like that beauty. Those who live like that smell like Truth more than all those who are seeking it. Contradiction all the way, baby.</br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>गढिमाईको मन्दीरमा</br>
मृत्यु नै त सत्य बन्यो</br>
न्याय बन्यो धर्म बन्यो</br>
सत्य सँधै एक्लो बन्यो ।</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will be my controversial take on this after studying this for some time. This is a thin moral line but I don&rsquo;t mind walking it.</br>
As long as you eat meat, its better if you eat it as offering to some force rather than eating it as is like an animal. Because that helps you understand and lower your ego better. At least, you are recognizing something bigger than you. Making it a festive in hopes to appease Goddess, not so much. FYI: Its not for the main deity that you think the sacrifice is for. <strong>Unless there is purity in your heart, much of it is a waste anyway.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>And for those who realize, they don&rsquo;t even have to do a Sattvic Yajna or a ritual offering flowers. There is only one true offering: offering of your ego (false identity).</strong></br></p>
<p>For those who realize, there is no difference between eating meat/ not eating meat.
I don&rsquo;t want to expound or teach anything.
If you have a Guru, do what he tells you to do. If you don&rsquo;t, guide it with your own moral compass. </br></p>
<p>You become more sensitive when you don&rsquo;t eat. It eases your meditation as well. Stopping just at this.</br></br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>कतै मुस्कान लहरसँगै</br>
कतै रगत खोलो बग्यो</br>
आलो रगत चरुसँगै</br>
सत्य यज्ञ भष्म बन्यो ।</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Death is one simple truth that we all know. The reason why they put Tika of &ldquo;Bhasma** on their forehead in some traditions of Hinduism relates to this idea beautifully. You need to adore death as your personal friend. There are so many sects in Hinduism and Buddhism that meditate on the cremation ground. Death is but natural for them. Those who see it see everything as indifferent from one another.</p>
<p>Yes, truth is in that &ldquo;Bhasma**. I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time. I know it now. And its much pure than the best of temples you visit where people pretend to be, but have no true compassion.</p>
<p>All ideas of morality are fake if you don&rsquo;t have an internal moral compass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>त्यै भष्मको कालो टीका</br>
धर्मको त प्रतिक बन्यो</br>
सत्य अब जलिसक्यो</br>
यो माटोलाई त्यागिसक्यो</br>
विनाशतिर लम्काएर</br>
संसारदेखि भागिसक्यो ।।</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this is the world we live in. Find those who don&rsquo;t pretend, who are raw. They might hurt you, they might pain you, but they will eventually lead you to truth. You shouldn&rsquo;t put on for anyone for it hides your being a little. Little by little, you forget who you are. You will be despised, desolate for doing so, but that&rsquo;s the path of Truth.</p>
<p><strong>Truth is personal. You cannot show it to someone who has closed their eyes by their own will.</strong>
</br></p>
<p>Just look at how Premanand Maharaj talks about his Bhakti. That is a smell most people can understand.</br></br></p>
<p>So, this is my conclusion. I have traveled far and wide within myself and the world to realize what I do today. I am raw here because you know that you can be, at least with yourself personally. It is the best weapon to tear through all illusions. </br></p>
<p><strong>A decade ago</strong>, I felt desolate, alone in my room. No idea where I was going, yet with almost everything that the world usually fights for. I had most of these things they wished, but it was only baggage for me. I didn&rsquo;t know who I was. The only time I felt home was when I was below the night sky, watching those stars. They made me feel like they were watching me, protecting me. I felt alone among all the people who knew me. And in that desolate moment, I couldn&rsquo;t see any light of truth anywhere. That&rsquo;s why I wrote that last verse.</p>
<p><strong>But today, I know that its almost everywhere for those who have the earnest eyes.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>For those who don&rsquo;t lie, even to themselves.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>For those who are sensitive enough to look for it even in the remotest of places. There are stories of Sufi saints living as Butchers, so open your eyes to the possibility.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t lie to yourself, even as self-deprecating humor.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>What you don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t assume. Ask if you have to. Write your things down.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>Be patient with answers. Some questions take years to get answered, some might get answered by next person you meet.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>Always be listening heartily, not to answer, listen to listen.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>Anchor yourselves in Truth and Truth alone. Sooner or later, you will find that what you are looking for.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>Be empathetic, be brave.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>Truth is not for cowards.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>There is a reason why they used emblem of Lotus flower. If you don&rsquo;t have courage to get yourselves dirty, you have no point asking for that Lotus.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>When you have that fragrance, the world will be a little bit more beautiful.</strong></br></p>
<p><strong>So, Bloom amidst the mud surrounding you</strong> !!</p>
