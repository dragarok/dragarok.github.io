                <p>&ldquo;!!&rdquo; I want to start with an exclamation. This year has been one of that year that I had been waiting for decades to happen to me. From the year 2023, it finally crossed the Tipping Point and started getting crazier.
There were parts about my identity that I really got to explore, go deep into, and really uncover myself piece by piece. Like going petal by petal in a lotus flower. 🪷</p>
<p>In the year 2024, I got the first clear glimpse. In the year 2025, I cleared my doubts, and learned about my path. In the year 2026, the path will be done, and I feel that a new journey is already waiting for me. I don&rsquo;t know how/what it will be, but it is surely going to demand more energy and vigor from my part.</p>
<p>In my own words, I wrote in my yearly review for 2024: &ldquo;2023 was speeding with insights. Its been a slow year compared to 2023 because everything was about calming down.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why 2025 happened, going supersonic. The questions I said that will get answered in 2024&rsquo;s review got answered as well.</p>
<p>I have started using emacs more with almost exact setup on my phone as well. Really tops Obsidian, Notion or any of that stuff because its the same workflow that I have on my mac as well. Its so much elegant now.</p>

</figure>

<p>These are my notes in org roam. It looks really beautiful and getting more and more connected each year. I wait for the day when I can throw it all on a AR setup and traverse through nodes like planets and galaxies in games.</p>
<figure><img src="../../../../ox-hugo/_20251128_082027screenshot.png">
</figure>

<p>Finally, I found who I was in relation to this world. After some time, no place was distant. I was at home almost all the time wherever I was. It got to the point when I knew that I wasn&rsquo;t the only witness to my life.</p>
<p>It all started with a firm conviction. A plan that I had for a long long time; one that my being had been waiting for, unaware without an idea of what would be coming. Its as if I projected one of my very first and favorite novel onto my life: &ldquo;The Alchemist.&rdquo; I even listened to that book in Nepali saying &ldquo;Kimiyagar&rdquo;. Just like him, I didn&rsquo;t know why but an unknown force pulled me towards an unknown place. I felt stupid at times to be walking in the dark, but in the end, that journey was meant to be mine; just like Santiago&rsquo;s journey was meant to be his and his only. Yes, he would have been deemed a fool if the story didn&rsquo;t end in riches, but who is keeping the tabs anyway?</p>
<p>I left my home in search of answers that I&rsquo;d been seeking. I knew I had to walk this path alone, and it became so. This was the very first moment of my life where I actually left &ldquo;home&rdquo;. The first 10 minutes of it, I can almost taste all of it even today. That journey was a lot. I started with my expectations of where I would go, but let myself be guided freely. I ended up in places I hadn&rsquo;t even planned to go. A lot of unknowns, yet with a sense of familiarity in conviction. Every place started like a stranger that I wanted to run away from asap, but ended up knowing that they&rsquo;ve been my besties all along. They made me cry as well as cried on my shoulder like family.</p>
<p>I was looking for specific something. In that process I came to know, the best of things are not meant to be looked for. The best of things find you. You don&rsquo;t find them. This is a very contradictory thing to say, yet its one of the most truthful things I can tell you. Think of it like this: Clear your pond of all the dirt that you have accumulated over the years. Nature will come to adorn your pond: birds, fishes etc. But if you just justify your laziness and your pond gets dirty, inaction will kill all the vibes. So, non-action is the key, not inaction. And there is a night and day of a difference between these two.</p>
<p>I saw both good and worse parts of humanity in same place. I saw truthful and liars in same robes. I saw power and surrender in same place. I felt fear and courage in same place. I saw death and beauty in same place. I heard the hardest of cries and playful laughter in the same place. I was silent and beaming with answers in same place. The duality of it, almost as if everything was a stage, set for my eyes to understand reality in its full glory. And it was just the start of 2025.</p>
<p>I travelled far and wide. I cried my eyes out in pain. I laughed with all my heart. I cried my eyes out in peace. I saw it all, that too in a very short time span. Literally made me binge it all in one go.</p>
<p>This was what I wrote in my diary when I returned:
&ldquo;When I truly seek, I have always been found. Thanks to everyone for loving me like its favorite child and treating me this way. I will do everything I can to give as much as I can. I know my actions for my personal seeking has been done. Those will be minor part of a major life force. I will be the torch bearer of life itself. The essence. The fragrance. I will make sure that I smell like life itself every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The convictions that found me led me to finding so much more. Overflowing with insights, I couldn&rsquo;t even keep track of things. Answers coming at supersonic speed. There were years where I struggled to even get one. This was year where I got answers to those questions that I didn&rsquo;t know I had deep longing for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d chosen Purple 🟣 for 2025, and that was not a coincidence. That was a conviction that could have only come from within. And life truly showed me that color. Now, I know what I needed to know. There are things that I know that I don&rsquo;t know, and its okay. There are things that I don&rsquo;t know that I don&rsquo;t know, and that&rsquo;s okay too.</p>
<p>So much convoluted talk. Basically, the summary is I finally got answers that I&rsquo;ve been searching for all my life. Exactly like a lost child finds home.
For 2026, there is no color, no shape, no form, no name. Just presence speaking for itself. One intention speaking: &ldquo;Be.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Be.&rdquo; Not A, not C. Just <strong>&ldquo;Be.&rdquo;</strong> 🫠</p>
<p>And I realized one major problem with my concepts that I had last year. The drawing that I had on my last year review about what creation/enlightenment failed to take into account the infinite nature of being. &ldquo;The infinity&rdquo;. There is no circle that binds either creation or enlightened beings. There is no Yin and Yang because its empty and boundless at the same time. Just like you cannot count the moments you lived even if you tried to break it down. You will end up going in an infinite regress on what counts as a moment. Just like Cantor showed us uncountable infinities with whole numbers.</p>
<p>The usual part of my yearly reviews I do is talking about what I read this year. I didn&rsquo;t watch much of movies/series this year. Nothing of note there. :</p>
<h2 id="completed-this-year">Completed this year</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Beginning of Infinity ( Started with The Beginning of Infinity. Ended with it as well. Its truly the beginning of Infinity for me starting next year. A great read on optimism, and our ability as humans to create better future. )</li>
<li>Category Theory for Programmers by Bartosz ( Had to re-read and understand the details I had been studying for quite some time. )</li>
<li>The Little Prince ( Such a beautiful read. &ldquo;It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.&rdquo; I think adults should read this every year so that you retain that innocence, and don&rsquo;t turn into a boring adult. )</li>
<li>How to succeed at Mrbeast Production ( Short read, good enough to understand few ideas on how anything goes viral. )</li>
<li>At the eleventh hour ( Biography of Swami Rama, wanted to know this person a little more )</li>
<li>High Agency Blog ( Would definitely recommend this one as well. Longer than a usual blog but truly worth it.)</li>
<li>Category Theory Illustrated ( Available as a blog or book. Basic yet real good intro to get the ideas through. Helped me so much to clarify what I&rsquo;d already studied. )</li>
<li>Laghu Parashari ( Started on Vedic Jyotish basics. Couldn&rsquo;t find time to go deep into that one area. )</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="skimmed-through">Skimmed through</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Million Thoughts: Learn all about meditation from a himalayan mystic after his 15000 hours of intense practice by Om Swami ( Found him through reels. He&rsquo;s knowledgeable, and has done a lot of spiritual Sadhana. Just picked this book up to see if there was specific something that I was trying to understand. )</li>
<li>The Pathless Path: Imagining a New Story for Work and Life by Paul Millerd ( Really good book if you still haven&rsquo;t understood work life balance and being in general. I&rsquo;d discovered same principles personally, and this is how I would have most likely structured too. So, definitely would recommend this. )</li>
<li>Introspect by visakanv ( Wanted to learn his perspective but was raw-dogging my own reality. So, didn&rsquo;t go much further. )</li>
<li>Do Nothing ( I wanted to see it from a different person&rsquo;s perspective. Literally felt redundant to me personally, so skimmed fast. )</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="still-in-progress">Still In Progress</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mahabharat by Ved Vyas ( Raw dogging both Sanskrit and Hindi directly from Gita Press. Still in Adi Parva. )</li>
<li>I am That by Nisargadatta Maharaj ( Restarted again towards the end of this year. Finally understood the title. I didn&rsquo;t have the intention to just mark it as complete last year. Same now. Just a few chapters over the span of the year. Has made me laugh more than anything else this year. )</li>
<li>Lessons on Vedic Astrology</li>
<li>Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra ( Covered Jyotish basics. Haven&rsquo;t found time to dig deeper. I like anything that has liberation as it&rsquo;s prime goal. I was quite surprised when I found out that the intention of this field was Liberation too. I just had different views because of how people propagated its knowledge. )</li>
<li>Adult Piano Adventures ( Practicing it slow but its hard to do so when you are moving constantly between places. )</li>
<li>Godel Escher Bach ( Opened a few pages but didn&rsquo;t go through much this year. )</li>
<li>The Brothers Karamazov ( Haven&rsquo;t found time to really dig on fiction this year because I feel like I need to get engulfed by it, and haven&rsquo;t had much time that way. Want to enjoy fiction like fine wine. )</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-read-this-year">Re-read this year</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Joy of Abstraction by Eugenia Cheng ( Summarized, re-read in detail to get the concepts clear this time )</li>
<li>The Zen and Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ( Felt much better when I revised my highlights as if philosophies were written first and covered with more for easy digestion. )</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>This year was not that as huge in terms of books because I was reading something else: people and their stories. I sat together with my grandfathers over fire listening and recording their stories. I learned about my ancestors, their history, their migration stories and so on. Learned that we can&rsquo;t even escape our ancestry. As I travelled more, I got to listen to a lot more stories.</li>
<li>I sat together with spiritual people over fire listening to their stories. I listened, and they told me so much more than what I was asking for. They felt home with me like I felt home with them. For the first time, I felt seen in that world.</li>
<li>I finally understood how a truly lived life is full of contradictions. Just like Love. One who is living from experience, and not memories.</li>
<li>I got to live with my parents for almost 8 months without interruption, first time after turning into an adult. Literally had to treat them like children because they were automatic, yet innocent. I brought their scars to the surface, made them cry a gazillion times; and now they love me more than they used to. I am a warm menace, that&rsquo;s all. LOL. I taught them just like I was teaching myself. I showed them my world, what matters to me and why. They still aren&rsquo;t fully convinced, but they are already off to a great start.</li>
<li>Built app to help people fight their fear and recognize themselves. Wrote a manifesto. (<a href="https://maitreyatools.com">https://maitreyatools.com</a>) 🐦‍🔥</li>
<li>Participated in a national protest that too from the front. First time for everything I guess. Wrote another manifesto. No stone pelting or violence, but exactly opposite of that. Saw so much more than what I was expecting. That&rsquo;s life. Felt all kind of emotions at the same time. Rightly so. I didn&rsquo;t want to get involved so soon into Politics, but when time calls for it, I couldn&rsquo;t let it pass. I did my part. Lets see what more I will do over time. I think there is a lot to come but lets stop at that for now.</li>
<li>I finally found the simplicity on the other side of complexity that I had been resolving for a decade personally.</li>
<li>This year is the oldest I&rsquo;ll ever be. I&rsquo;ll start getting younger and younger, starting this year. The Divine told me this. 🤭</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ll recognize that what&rsquo;s represented by that name I gave myself years ago subconsciously which is at the top of this blog too. &ldquo;There are no accidents, Shifu&rdquo;, said Oogway too.</p>
