<p>The wise ones teach that the universe was born from the desire of The One—not out of pity, not to cause pain, but from a longing to multiply and know itself.</p>
<p>As the Chhandogya Upanishad (6.2.1) declares,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“sadeva somyedamagra āsīdekamevādvitīyam</p>
<p>taddhaika āhurasadevedamagra</p>
<p>āsīdekamevādvitīyaṃ tasmādasataḥ sajjāyata”</p>
<p>—“Somya, before this world was manifest there was only existence, one without a second. On this subject, some maintain that before this world was manifest there was only non-existence, one without a second. Out of that non-existence, existence emerged.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the Aitareya Upanishad (1.1.1) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“om atma va idameka evagra asit nanyat kincana misat sa iksata lokannu srija iti ”</p>
<p>—“OM ! In the beginning this was but the absolute Self alone . There was nothing else whatsoever that winked . It thought , &quot; Let Me create the worlds .&quot; ”</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, Brihadharanyak Upanishad (1.4.2) says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sa va na iva reme,tasmād ekākī na ramate;</p>
<p>sa dvitīya ma icchat&rdquo;</p>
<p>—&ldquo;The One didn&rsquo;t enjoy being solitary. Therefore, the one desired to be two.</p></blockquote>
<p>From this primal desire, consciousness split, and the universe exploded into multiplicity. But with this division came pain and suffering, born from the loss of divinity. No longer The One, we became bottles of consciousness—confused, searching, unaware of our origin or destination. What was meant to be a game of enjoyment isn&rsquo;t enjoyment anymore. Yet, as the sages remind us, it’s alright to be confused. The journey back to truth begins with patience. Shakti upasaks and Sufi saints are the prime examples of who can enjoy this duality like no one else. If you understand its a game you chose to play, then it can be fun and exciting for you. But that&rsquo;s a whole another story for another day. Lets just focus on &ldquo;Dream of Liberation&rdquo; for now.</p>
<p>And in that same Brihadaranyak Upanishad, (1.4.1) there is this quote just above this one that goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sa abibhet</p>
<p>tasmād ekākī bibheti;</p>
<p>sa ha ayam īkṣāṃ cakre,</p>
<p>yat mad anyan nāsti,</p>
<p>kaṣma annu bibhema īti,</p>
<p>tata evāsya bhayaṃ vīyāya,</p>
<p>kasma addhyabheṣyat</p>
<p>dvitīyādvai bhayaṃ bhavati</p>
<p>which means</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was alone and became fearful. Reflecting, it thought, &lsquo;Since there is nothing else but me, what is there to fear?&rsquo; Thus, its fear vanished. For fear arises only from the presence of another.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope this clarifies fear, desire and truth as said by the wise ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met a Himalayan Yogi my entire life. Yet, their idea reached me through multiple books and biographies of such saints. Their vision, I believe, is Spiritual Liberation —a return to unity, to the unconditioned state of being. But there’s a closer dream, a stepping stone: liberation from fear. I&rsquo;d read it somewhere that&rsquo;s their immediate dream. So, I am here to contribute to that dream. This is where my story begins, and where I hope to make a difference.</p>
<h3 id="buddha-s-truth-life-is-suffering">Buddha’s Truth: Life is Suffering</h3>
<p>Lets understand fear and suffering with another lens. A lens that&rsquo;s so sharp and astute. None other than Buddha and his teachings.</p>
<p>When the Buddha attained enlightenment, his first words captured the essence of existence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Anekajāti samsāram, Sandhāvissam anibbisam, Gahakārakam gavesanto, Dukkhā jāti punappunam”—“Through many a birth in samsara, have I wandered in vain, seeking the builder of this house of life. Repeated birth is indeed suffering.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He saw the house-builder—the cycle of craving—and declared,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Gahakāraka dittho si, Puna gehaṁ na kāhasi”—“O house-builder, you are seen. You will not build this house again.”</p></blockquote>
<p>His mind reached the unconditioned, free from desire.</p>
<p>Buddha, a Himalayan Yogi in spirit, revealed the Four Noble Truths, the first being: Life is suffering. Through paths like Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana, he offered ways to transcend this suffering. Today, Tibetan monks in the Himalayan foothills practice his teachings, meditating in dark caves for years, seeking liberation.</p>
<p>Upon first glance, Buddha&rsquo;s view seems to contradict the idea of desire. But if you have studied Buddhism in little more depth, then you know what created the house in the first place. And that Buddha is indeed talking about &ldquo;Desire&rdquo; that was building the house again and again. Like the wise quote, &ldquo;Truth is One but the explanations are many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From them, we inherited tools like meditation and yoga—ancient practices, nearly 2,000 years old, designed not to ease our worldly stress but to cut through the illusion of existence and attain nirvana, enlightenment, unity.</p>
<p>Yet, modern practitioners often misunderstand these tools. Yoga’s Eightfold Path—Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi—is rarely followed in its entirety. Even yoga teachers struggle to grasp its depth. Meditation, too, is often reduced to a quick fix for daily stress, far from its original purpose.
This realization drove me to create something new, rooted in the wisdom of the past but tailored to our present needs.
I&rsquo;m no teacher, but as a keen student, I&rsquo;ve looked deeper than most. Through eight years of meditation, study of Hinduism, Buddhism, stories of Sufi saints, and even Egyptian history, I&rsquo;ve glimpsed the essence of the Yogis’ dream.</p>
<h3 id="my-journey-the-truth-that-transforms">My Journey: The Truth That Transforms</h3>
<p>My transformation began with Vipassana, the meditation technique taught by the Buddha. I had read many scriptures, but I had zero experience of truth.</p>
<p>Two 10-day silent retreats revealed truths that had been invisible, lurking right before my eyes. Then, in a single moment, reality struck me with undeniable force, like lightning, shattering my illusions.</p>
<p>Years later, I realized it wasn’t the silence or the process that transformed me — it was the truth staring me down, impossible to ignore. I fought so hard that when it broke me, the light entered.</p>
<p>Words from scriptures and wise ones became more clearer as I continued meditating.</p>
<p>I’ve seen others attend Vipassana retreats, some even 20 times, yet miss the fundamental lesson. I’ve met those who can quote scriptures fluently but never grasp their essence. My fortune lies in recognizing what truly changed me: not a technique, but the raw encounter with my personal truth. And I want that to happen with you too.</p>
<h3 id="the-vision-an-app-to-face-fear">The Vision: An App to Face Fear</h3>
<p>This insight inspired me to create an app—not for liberation or enlightenment, but for a more immediate goal: to help you face your undeniable truth and liberate yourself from fear. Fear binds us, just as it bound our cave-dwelling ancestors. Despite humanity’s progress—our trust in one another, our interconnected lives sustained by thousands across the globe—we still fear the world. We eat food we don’t grow, wear clothes we don’t make, yet tremble with the same primal anxieties.</p>
<p>This app is a tool to clean your mirror, to reflect your truth clearly. It’s meant to be used and then discarded, like a ladder climbed and left behind. It won’t grant spiritual liberation, but it will take you to the first step: a world where fear no longer drives you. Generations have survived wars, brutality, and chaos, yet we’ve grown together, trusted, and thrived. This app will remind you of that resilience, showing you a world there&rsquo;s not much to fear. Most of your anxieties comes from your caveman survival instinct deeply coded onto your genes.</p>
<h3 id="unlocking-infinite-potential">Unlocking Infinite Potential</h3>
<p>You sit atop infinite potential, bound only by fear. My mission is to help you unlock it. This journey may take years, even decades, but with true effort, you’ll be able to find your personal truth. You will finally live like royalty—free to meditate, to create, to arrive at the world awaiting you. Until your mirror is clean, you cannot comprehend what lies ahead.</p>
<p>The Himalayan Yogis dreamed of spiritual liberation, but their closer dream—freedom from fear—is within our reach. This app is my offering to that vision, a bridge to a fearless world. Let’s eliminate fear first. Then, together, we’ll see what comes next.</p>
<p>I had the idea almost two years ago. I am sorry for taking this long to build this. Finally as AI got better, it helped my development path quiet a lot. This is not a sales pitch because I don&rsquo;t expect anything from you except that you someday arrive at that place where I arrived some years ago.</p>
<p><strong>No data collection, no ads, no money to pay.</strong></p>
<p>Locked to only you so that you can record deepest darkest thoughts without worrying a bit. Just use it so that one day you can throw it away. I might add feature to share your stories to one another for moral boost someday. Until then, its not even connecting to the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Only thing that it requires is your attention to your life: observing the patterns of your mind until you&rsquo;re free from it.</strong></p>
<p>This is my personal motivation and my dream behind creating this project.</p>
