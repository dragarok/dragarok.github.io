            <div class="post-content">
                <p>If you think about world from good mental models, you&rsquo;ve already recognized that traditional structures in this world are falling. Be it Politics, Business, Education and so on. As if a switch was pressed, and it started getting more and more random. Ray Dalio has written a book on &ldquo;The Changing World Order&rdquo;. With close observation, its hard to not take a note.</p>
<p>Previously, money and leverage were tied to very non-random outcomes. There are decentralized commodities. Now, look at what altcoins and crypto is doing. One person is grinding their entire life saving pennies, and there&rsquo;s another one who gains and loses like a gambling game. But if you look closely enough, its a form of currency we have accepted and used. So, you are a part of that gambling match whether you know crypto or not. Big countries might adapt it, and a lot of lives change. Big countries make it illegal, and a lot of lives change.</p>
<p>And that gambling match is getting more and more aggressive as the world is not clear about its order. Countries forming alliances, countries fighting within alliances. Revolutions, Trade Bans, Tariffs, Wars have spiked up in different places of the world. There were conflicts before, but now there&rsquo;s no locus.</p>
<p>This is about the external world. Then comes our internal world. We think we have more choices in everything, then we get into &ldquo;Paradox of Choice&rdquo; making us not make delay choices and accept worse outcomes. Everyone looking for perfection that&rsquo;s nowhere to be found outside. The ideals being defined by what we see in social media is making everyone restless. Everyone wants to reduce shame, yet be famous. Everyone wants to get good bits of asymmetry without the bad bits. That pulls us apart and tears us from the inside. It would undoubtedly have been better if our society would have been kind and competent. In reality, we know that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there is a huge influencer economy of incompetent advice. Promoting products that they never use, cult-like following and all of that because of our behavior. We follow stupidly, that&rsquo;s why most modern day influencers have a huge fan following. Then when that stupidity turns into hate, it becomes very chaotic for the same person who enjoyed that asymmetry before. Influencers pretending a happy lifestyle making us feel even more miserable. How did we get here? Who are these seemingly &ldquo;out-of-nowhere&rdquo; experts? Excluding very few amazing people wanting to share their knowledge and art to the world. They are getting outshined by clickbait experts usually.</p>
<p>The career we study for in universities gets outdated faster than ever. New fields popping out randomly. Every new article says this job is at risk. That career is at risk, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>People think understanding what it is doesn&rsquo;t help anything, but its not true. You have to understand the structure to break the structure apart safely. How do we deal with it then? Everything seems overwhelming. Everything seems fragile. Everything seems too random. Where is the answer?</p>
<p>The answer is in randomness itself. If you come from a Computer Science background, you study a sorting algorithm called &ldquo;Quick Sort&rdquo;. Quick Sort uses randomness to sort numbers efficiently. And you also probably know that quick sort isn&rsquo;t opimal when its not very random, but given that the data is random and huge, that&rsquo;s where it shines.</p>
<p>Think of all the modern information signals as random numbers. And you know there is chaos everywhere. And you know there are so many numbers that influence you. e.g. If you compare 30 years ago to today, just count the number of things that try to give information to your mind. It has increased a million fold. So, the bigger the randomness, the better it is for the algorithm that sorts it.</p>
<p>But what happens during a quick sort?</p>
<p>Quick sort &ldquo;sort of&rdquo; harnesses this randomness. It begins by selecting a pivot: a single element from the array that serves as its reference point. That can be any pivot. There is no rule to create a pivot. It&rsquo;s not chosen for perfection but for its ability to divide the chaos into manageable parts. Numbers smaller than the pivot go left, larger ones go right. Then the process recurses on these subsets, partitioning again and again until order emerges from this disorder. These subsets are where we can still create some structure using our knowledge and understanding of randomness itself.</p>
<p>Example illustration:</p>
<figure><img src="../../../../ox-hugo/_20260116_060716screenshot.png">
</figure>

<p>But one key catch like I mentioned earlier is this: without randomness, Quick Sort can falter. On a more rigid traditional structure (like a nearly sorted list), poor pivot choices lead to unbalanced partitions, dragging efficiency down to a crawl. Introduce randomness—say, by randomly selecting the pivot—and the algorithm thrives, achieving near-optimal performance on average. So, the understanding is this: If there was a good structure that already had less randomness and jitter, you would have been well off by following traditional algorithms and patterns.</p>
<p>Understand this: The world is now best for people who have the courage to follow an unconventional path. Reduce shame. Be more courageous. I know it&rsquo;s easier said than done, but you&rsquo;ve got nowhere that&rsquo;s safe. It won&rsquo;t happen instantly, but you can work your way through. Start by playing around with pivots that need less courage and don&rsquo;t provoke immediate fear-response. Then as you get more confident, you will increase the stakes and bigger sorting games. Focus is an asymmetric skill when everyone is in fragmented. Calmness is an asymmetric skill when everyone is in panic. These meta-skills will turn out to be more helpful in times to come. Randomness breeds curiosity.</p>
<p>Just need to understand this final lesson from quick sort: you don&rsquo;t keep changing pivots assuming that there can be a better pivot. You choose a pivot, divide it, and then start working on that subset. If each new information point ( number in our set) wants to keep changing pivot and not go to the immediate subsets, you fuck yourselves up. It never moves. It gets stuck on the first layer without any sorting. Because choosing a pivot is for breaking it into subsets and working on those subsets. <strong>If you make choosing better pivot a game, then you are stuck infinitely in this randomness without getting anywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>Understand the randomness so that you can split it apart into manageable chunks and work on it. One random pivot, and the structure can emerge without you even being aware that such a pivot/a point of leverage even exists in the first place. Try new things. Learn to switch quickly from one AI model to another without getting disrupted. Learn to break traditional learning methodologies with new developments in AI and LLMs. Invest in crypto randomly [ Given its legal in your country ] ( Amount you can safely lose and you wouldn&rsquo;t even know ). Do binge into random topics to know about structures that are building there. And invest before anyone else. This is the mindset I believe is needed for the future.</p>
<p>Those who keep updating their world models with each new development. Those who glide from one uncertainty to another without getting torn apart will be the ones who will shine in this new age.
&ldquo;Uncertainty is the new certainty until it changes with AGI.&rdquo;</p>
