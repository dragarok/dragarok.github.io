                <p>I have been trying to write some essays on basic words that are the hardest to capture because often times it&rsquo;s these words that stir up conflict: love, happiness, fulfillment, peace, pain, god,  spirituality etc.
Because they are the most overused, yet least understood by our subconscious minds, our subconscious gets trippy while making sense.
I started writing this essay about six months ago.  In trying to write this essay, I started by searching for word love in my personal notes vault. It got overwhelming even after a day digesting, that I gave up the pursuit for some time. I really didn&rsquo;t have any digest apart from notes and excerpts from others. I knew where to start, but couldn&rsquo;t end it.</p>
<p>This is where I start. Where is love word used often? Whenever anyone feels like there is an intensity of anything, they call it love.
Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desire</strong> : Love for ownership</li>
<li><strong>Passion</strong> : Love for fulfillment</li>
<li><strong>Sex</strong> : Love for pleasure</li>
<li><strong>Flow</strong> : Love for work</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.
If love is just intensity at its peak, why is love praised that much? Can you call intense greed as love for greed? If not, why do you call high intensity to cause violence as <strong>love for violence</strong>. If it can be used on any connotation, is there really anything praiseworthy about it?
e.g.</p>
<p><strong>Paulo Coelho in The Alchemist</strong> says maybe love simply is nourishment and compares love to a falcon&rsquo;s flight over the sand being definition of love given by the desert. The desert reasons that falcon carries bits of itself, and feeds the falcon little water that it has right there; thus the nourishment.</p>
<p><strong>Lao Tzu in Tao Te Ching</strong> talks about love without imposing the will, love as a leader, love as a mystery, and posits a spiritual question. &ldquo;Is greatest love indifferent?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Gracia Marquez in One Hundred Years of Solitude</strong> shows how you see love everywhere, how passion and love interchangably entangle, whether we can be exhausted of love, and whether two solitary people can be in love.
Charles Bukwoski has a book titled &ldquo;Love is a dog from hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There will be thousand more references to word love if you google it. I deferred this essay and  had been trying to answer other questions related to fear and death instead for last year. All of a sudden, both the answers came at the same time. Finally, I had an essay I wanted to share.</p>
<p>I want to make note of what&rsquo;s easiest about describing love. Love with a person. Though I start with romantic love, the conclusion applies to any love. Love with a person, thing, God, or anything.
I will start with loving someone as I have come to know it. I have been close with a few people emotionally. Had multitudes of experience from love at first sight ( in people&rsquo;s words ) to being in a relationship. I have connected with someone on a purely intellectual level where we had so much topics in common that we talked for hours on end, and never get tired. I have been emotionally involved with someone who matched most of my interests. It was fun to talk to and hangout with that someone. I thought I was at least in love when I was with someone in a relationship, in possessing someone whom I called mine. At that time I thought life was about one love and I believed it to be love for a very long time. Then I liked someone, wanted to be with them, but never really feeling like being with them. At some point, I saw love in trying to emapthize for someone. There were few days where situation would make it feel like a perfect match but that was pleasure misinterpreted as love.</p>
<p>What people call love at first sight was all hormones piling up to give one of the most pleasurable experiences, but not really love. On my first ever love at first sight, I really felt music buzz my ears, stomach curled up when I saw her. I was sure she was an angel that evening. But hormones fade, as fast as they pile up. That&rsquo;s what love at first sight is. It&rsquo;s a biological response of you liking someone because nature wants you to breed.</p>
<p>Being intimate emotionally and intellectually with someone is freedom, one degree close to love than even that pleasure where you had a crush. You put down your guards. It&rsquo;s not overwhelming like the first one, but much more relieving. A crush moment is instantaneous, but intimacy lasts.</p>
<p>Being in a relationship came as a whole different story. They are already as important as your family, and when you have accepted their most vices as inconsequential is even more closer to love than anything else. This is what I thought was love till the moment because that was all that I had experienced. You possess them as yours. You feel safe with them. Most of the feeling comes from not having an emotional void to express with someone when in a relationship.</p>
<p>I thought that was all there is. Thus, I believed the highest attainment is love where two people are in a relationship, like each other, and spend their lives together. They are individuals, but they like spending their life together rather than all alone.</p>
<p>Then came my final experience, which needed me to redefine what I had known so far.
This is love where I experienced this wierdness that I had a difficult time finding words to describe.</p>
<p>Lets start with a context first.</p>
<p>I had crush on someone for some time. I got to talking with that someone, meeting them too. At that time, I was trying to see as many people as I can, in a hope to understand my preferences better. That someone didn&rsquo;t want to take it forward, so I left that situation the best I can. I was dating other people, but very briefly. I got stuck on that someone emotionally.</p>
<p>I was still unsure whether I wanted to be with them because I couldn&rsquo;t take this in a normal pace. I was already thinking long term without knowing them enough. And making decisions quickly on emotional matters is not my forte. I tried hard to move away from them, dated a few other people, but still stuck.</p>
<p>I had one doubt about that person being the right match, that&rsquo;s why I never went all in. One day while reading a book, I came to an understanding that opened that barrier for me.
It had been an year or so since I had last talked. I decided to take a chance and take it as it goes even if it ends up hurting me. I called to meet and that someone agreed.</p>
<p>First I was happy, then I was anxious. I almost had forgotten how anxiety felt like because I was experiencing any sort of anxiety after almost a year. To give you context, I have been meditating for years now, and am rarely anxious. That day, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep and decided to meditate.</p>
<p>Meditation is where my inner lake gets calm. Half an hour into that, I realized anxiety arises from desire, not from love. I still meditated. There is a practice called &ldquo;Metta&rdquo; ( Good will and Gratitude Practice ) that&rsquo;s done at the end of Vipassana meditation practice. It usually is done for the last five minutes, but I decided to do it amidst my one hour practice that day. Also, I decided to do Metta just for that someone. In that practice of radiating love, after 10 minutes or so, my desire slowly faded away. Voila!! There was no anxiety.</p>
<p>I was peaceful, full of love, and cheerful. It felt so fucking weird that I couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it. It didn&rsquo;t last very long, about an hour or so after I woke from meditation. But at that moment, I felt blissed like I had never been before. The weiredest part is that I was unafraid of even death. It felt like even if someone stabbed me in that moment, I would die peacefully with a smile on my face. There was one more catch to it: I had always heard about how ego is the final barrier in spiritual path, to which I realized I had no ego that whole time. Not even a tinge of it. I was ready to give anything and everything up cheerfully.</p>
<p>I had been reading and meditating on death and fear for almost an year now in trying to overcome it. I had built a decent enough understanding about the topics, but not really nailed it. I was still seeking for an answer. I had no idea that my answer would come this way.</p>
<p>Even when that someone decided lastly that they didn&rsquo;t want to meet me, there was pain. But I didn&rsquo;t want that pain to subside. I remained aware and calm through it. I wanted to feel everything in its fullest depth. My logical mind couldn&rsquo;t  make sense because that was not how people I saw dealt with heartbreak neither in real life nor in movies. I wanted to just feel everything without diverting it by movies, songs, drinking, or activity of any sort. Seeing this, my mind created a doubt as to whether I really was in love or I was just faking myself. Only because that experience was way too vivid and absorbing, denying that didn&rsquo;t come easy.</p>
<p>Days passed and I still couldn&rsquo;t  believe what happened.
Over a period of a month, I came across some references that described what I felt. I stumbled across couple more references, and then I finally found my answer as to what happened.</p>
<p>First is a story told by Osho:
One day desire and knowledge met with Ganga. Ganga told both of them that she would purify them. Knowledge didn&rsquo;t go but desire did. When desired came purified out of the river, it&rsquo;d became love.</p>
<p>I found few Rumi&rsquo;s quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>From understading comes love.</li>
<li>Exhale only love.</li>
<li>Close your eyes, fall in love, stay there.</li>
<li>You have within you more love than you could ever understand.</li>
<li>Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guy was in love like no one else. I felt connection to these lines immediately after seeing one. It would have been impossible for me to express it, had it not been this guy who had said it already. My experience would have been lost to my logic and memory had I not found his lines.</p>
<p>Finally, it does not like a hallucination or a dream I created. Though that state lasted only an hour or so, that was real. That was how Rumi loved The Godhead. That&rsquo;s what love as in love is. Everything else is love added with something: sometimes with desire, sometimes with pleasure, sometimes with work, sometimes with passion etc.</p>
<p>Experiences and insights from meditation rarely last long. It takes one moment to see the door, but years more to absorb it into day-to-day life. I am grateful that I got a rare glimpse.</p>
<p><strong>This is my essay &ldquo;On Love&rdquo;.</strong></p>
