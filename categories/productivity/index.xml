      <description>Solutions ID: 14c476ff-c39c-47f8-a6f4-cd08e38f4ea1 Mindfulness Knowing what you are thinking of and what is happening internally will help you understand how irrational thoughts surface and develop with time. To help with thought interruptions, keep a timer, rubber band or something that constantly stays with you and add it to your lifestyle purposefully for that mental activity interruption.
