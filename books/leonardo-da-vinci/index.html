<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 138 - he became the archetype of the Renaissance Man, an inspiration to all who believe that the “infinite works of nature,” as he put it, are woven together in a unity filled with marvelous patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 142 - His scientific explorations informed his art. He peeled flesh off the faces of cadavers, delineated the muscles that move the lips, and then painted the world’s most memorable smile. He studied human skulls, made layered drawings of the bones and teeth, and conveyed the skeletal agony of Saint Jerome in the Wilderness. He explored the mathematics of optics, showed how light rays strike the cornea, and produced magical illusions of changing visual perspectives in The Last Supper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 147 - This ability to “make a flat surface display a body as if modeled and separated from this plane,” Leonardo said, was “the first intention of the painter.”3 Largely due to his work, dimensionality became the supreme innovation of Renaissance art. As he aged, he pursued his scientific inquiries not just</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 183 - Vision without execution is hallucination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 202 - Over and over again, year after year, Leonardo lists things he must do and learn. Some involve the type of close observation most of us rarely pause to do. “Observe the goose’s foot: if it were always open or always closed the creature would not be able to make any kind of movement.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 205 - “Why is the fish in the water swifter than the bird in the air when it ought to be the contrary since the water is heavier and thicker than the air?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 230 - mastering his insights, or mustering a modicum of his talents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 313 - Antonio di Piero del Vaccha, he was called Accattabriga, which means “Troublemaker,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 335 - “The man who has intercourse aggressively and uneasily will produce children who are irritable and untrustworthy,” he wrote, “but if the intercourse is done with great love and desire on both sides, the child will be of great intellect, witty, lively, and lovable.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 386 - I am fully aware that my not being a man of letters may cause certain presumptuous people to think that they may with reason blame me, alleging that I am a man without learning. Foolish folk! . . . They strut about puffed up and pompous, decked out and adorned not with their own labors, but by those of others. . . . They will say that because I have no book learning I cannot properly express what I desire to describe—but they do not know</p>

They will say that because I have no book learning I cannot properly express what I desire to describe—but they do not know that my subjects require experience rather than the words of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 411 - “Writing about the kite seems to be my destiny since among the first recollections of my infancy, it seemed to me that, as I was in my cradle, a kite came to me and opened my mouth with its tail and struck me several times with its tail inside my lips.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 431 - Leonardo said so himself. “Intellectual passion drives out sensuality,” he wrote in one of his notebooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 446 - “Oh time, swift despoiler of all things, how many kings, how many nations hast thou undone, and how many changes of states and of circumstances have happened since this wondrous fish perished.” By this point</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 450 - “The rivers will be deprived of their waters, the earth will no longer put forth her greenery; the fields will no more be decked with waving corn; all the animals, finding no fresh grass for pasture, will die,” he wrote. “In this way the fertile and fruitful earth will be forced to end with the element of fire; and then its surface will be left burnt up to cinder and this will be the end of all earthly nature.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 513 - “Beautiful Florence has all seven of the fundamental things a city requires for perfection,” the essayist Benedetto Dei wrote in 1472, when Leonardo was living there. “First of all, it enjoys complete liberty; second, it has a large, rich, and elegantly dressed population; third, it has a river with clear, pure water, and mills within its walls; fourth, it rules over castles, towns, lands and people; fifth, it has a university, and both Greek and accounting are taught; sixth, it has masters in every art; seventh, it has banks and business agents all over the world.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 534 - More than a century before Leonardo arrived, the most prosperous merchants and guild leaders crafted a republic whose elected delegates met at the Palazzo della Signoria, now known as the Palazzo Vecchio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 542 - By managing the fortunes of the continent’s wealthy families, the Medici made themselves the wealthiest of them all. They were innovators in bookkeeping, including the use of debit-and-credit accounting that became one of the great spurs to progress during the Renaissance. By means of payoffs and plotting, Cosimo became the de facto ruler of Florence, and his patronage made it the cradle of Renaissance art and humanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 553 - During his twenty-three-year reign, he would sponsor innovative artists, including Botticelli and Michelangelo, as well as patronize the workshops of Andrea del Verrocchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Antonio del Pollaiuolo, which were producing paintings and sculptures to adorn the booming city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 772 - From the eyes of his angel in the Baptism of Christ to the smile of the Mona Lisa, the blurred and smoke-veiled edges allow a role for our own imagination. With no sharp lines, enigmatic glances and smiles can flicker mysteriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 901 - His Tobias leans in as he strides, his cloak billowing out behind him while tassels and threads flutter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 946 - Like most artists, Verrocchio drew lines to delineate the contours of his angel’s head and face and eyes. But in Leonardo’s angel, there are no clear edges that delineate the features. The curls dissolve gently into each other and the face, rather than creating a hairline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1065 - mother and child seem to have of the crucifixion. The carnation,</p>
</li>
