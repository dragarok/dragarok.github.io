<p>loc 98 - and see it made real in your own and others’ lives. In my own way, I have tried to follow my beliefs, to do what I loved doing. I have tried, however, to guide but not to impose my views on others. You will find in this book plain speaking: Surge ahead as a developed nation or perish in perpetual poverty, subservient to a few countries that control the world politically and economically. There are no other alternatives. In the nine chapters of this book, I take up various themes. I begin with a rumination on peace, without which there can be no progress, and on the shift in the direction of my own life that occurred after surviving a helicopter crash. There is a chapter based on my interaction with children all over India. Other chapters contain the insights I gained in my meetings with saints and seers, scientists, outstanding thinkers and others. There are accounts of some promising experiments in agriculture and in the medical field. Elsewhere I deal with concepts that carry the seed of solutions. The contents essentially come from the</p>

<p>loc 259 - requested to be relieved in a month’s time. He relented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1400 - Because data on the engine, control system and some other sub-system drawings coming from my friends got delayed, I also got delayed by more than two weeks in submitting my drawings. It was a humid evening in the month of August. I was working on the drawing board. Dr Srinivasan, on his way to the tennis court, peeped into my room and looked at my work. He realized that I was nowhere near completion. He said, ‘Kalam, if you do not complete it in three days’ time your scholarship will be stopped.’ That was a big jolt for me. The scholarship was my lifeline, as my father could not afford the high cost of education at MIT. I had to make the best use of the time available. Three days was too short a time to complete it. I would have to work continuously. And this is what I decided to do. I slept on a bench in the college for three nights and went out only for food. Exactly after three days, Dr Srinivasan visited my drawing board. He spent nearly one hour examining what I had done and said, ‘This is good. You have performed a few weeks’ work in a few days.’ Coming from him, it was a great compliment. I realized then that if something is at stake, the human mind gets ignited and working capacity gets enhanced manifold. Challenges throw up opportunities. Once one selects a task, one should get immersed in it. Either you will succeed or fail; that risk will always be there. This should not deter you. When you fail, you still have the experience gained to draw upon in the future. Start by risking your own position for a mission. Either I deliver or I go. Prepare yourself for the endeavour.

<p>loc 204 - A man is said to pass through different stages in his lifetime. Dr Wayne W. Dyer, in his book Manifest Your Destiny, makes an interesting categorization of them as athelete stage, warrior stage, statesperson stage and spirit stage. It occurred to me that nations too make a similar transition and in extending this analogy to them I have termed the last two stages big brother and self- realization stages respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 244 - However, when children ask me, ‘What has given you happiness in your life in the last forty years?’ I say I get happiness when heart patients carry KR coronary stent in their arteries and when the physically handicapped children fitted with the lightweight Floor Reaction Orthosis (FRO) callipers find their difficulties eased somewhat. Both of these came as spin-offs from missile technologies.</p>
