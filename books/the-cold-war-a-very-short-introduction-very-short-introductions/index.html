<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 209 - A conflict that ranks, by any conceivable measure, as the most destructive in human history, World War II brought unparalleled levels of death, devastation, privation, and disorder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 222 - Winston S. Churchill, in characteristically vivid prose, described postwar Europe as ‘a rubble heap, a charnel house, a breeding ground of pestilence and hate’. Berlin was ‘an utter wasteland’,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 245 - Two continent-sized military behemoths – already being dubbed superpowers – had risen in its stead, each intent upon forging a new order consonant with its particular needs and values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 269 - The nation’s gross domestic product doubled between 1941 and 1945, bestowing the wonders of a highly productive, full-employment economy on a citizenry that had become accustomed to the deprivations imposed by a decade-long depression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 374 - The fact that one of history’s most brutal, ruthless, and suspicious rulers presided over the Soviet Union’s delicate balancing act at this critical juncture adds an unavoidable personal element to the story of Moscow’s postwar ambitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 389 - half a loaf when pursuit of a full loaf seemed likely to generate resistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 393 - A deep-seated belief in the teachings of Marx and Lenin imparted to them a messianic faith in the future, a reassuring sense of confidence that, whatever travails Moscow might face in the short run, history lay on their side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 398 - If ideological certitude at times bred a cautious patience, at other times it distorted reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 411 - The Kremlin’s rulers, for their part, saw the United States as the ringleader of the capitalist powers that had sought to strangle their regime at infancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 413 - Washington’s belated recognition of the Soviet Union, which came 17 years after the state’s establishment, was insufficient to drain the reservoir of bad blood, especially since Stalin’s efforts to knit together a common front against Hitler’s resurgent Germany in the mid- and late 1930s were met with indifference from the United States and other Western powers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 417 - For its part, the United States entered the post-World War I period with nothing but disdain for an unruly, unpredictable regime that had confiscated property, repudiated pre-war debts, and pledged support for working-class revolutions across the globe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 425 - Before then, the Faustian pact between Germany and Russia had just served to intensify American distaste for Stalin’s regime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 431 - Consequently, beginning in the summer of 1941, the United States commenced shipping military supplies to the Soviet Union in order to bolster the Red Army’s chances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 435 - ‘If Hitler invaded Hell’, he quipped, ‘I would make at least a favourable reference to the devil in the House of Commons.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 533 - Potsdam Conference of July 1945.</p>
</li>
