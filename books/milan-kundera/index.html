<li>
<p>loc 306 - The idea of eternal return</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 308 - Putting it negatively, the myth of eternal return states that a life which disappears once and for all, which does not return, is like a shadow, without weight, dead in advance, and whether it was horrible, beautiful, or sublime, its horror, sublimity, and beauty mean nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 332 - This reconciliation with Hitler reveals the profound moral perversity of a world that rests essentially on the nonexistence of return, for in this world everything is pardoned in advance and therefore everything cynically permitted. 2 If every second of our lives recurs an infinite number of times, we are nailed to eternity as Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 332 - This reconciliation with Hitler reveals the profound moral perversity of a world that rests essentially on the nonexistence of return, for in this world everything is pardoned in advance and therefore everything cynically permitted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 348 - The heaviest of burdens crushes us, we sink beneath it, it pins us to the ground. But in the love poetry of every age, the woman longs to be weighed down by the man&rsquo;s body. The heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life&rsquo;s most intense fulfillment. The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 377 - Should he call her back to Prague for good? He feared the responsibility. If he invited her to come, then come she would, and offer him up her life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 387 - Did he want her to come or did he not? He looked out over the courtyard at the opposite walls, seeking an answer. He kept recalling her lying on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 396 - But was it love? The feeling of wanting to die beside her was clearly exaggerated: he had seen her only once before in his life! Was it simply the hysteria of a man who, aware deep down of his inaptitude for love, felt the self-deluding need to simulate it? His unconscious was so cowardly that the best partner it could choose for its little comedy was this miserable provincial waitress with practically no chance at all to enter his life!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 410 - He remained annoyed with himself until he realized that not knowing what he wanted was actually quite natural. We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 415 - That is why life is always like a sketch. No, &ldquo;sketch&rdquo; is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline of something, the groundwork for a picture, whereas the sketch that is our life is a sketch for nothing, an outline with no picture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 471 - Tomas did not realize at the time that metaphors are dangerous. Metaphors are not to be trifled with. A single metaphor can give birth to love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 516 - The unwritten contract of erotic friendship stipulated that Tomas should exclude all love from his life. The moment he violated that clause of the contract, his other mistresses would assume inferior status and become ripe for insurrection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 561 - Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 648 - All languages that derive from Latin form the word &ldquo;compassion&rdquo; by combining the prefix meaning &ldquo;with&rdquo; (corn-) and the root meaning &ldquo;suffering&rdquo; (Late Latin, passio</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 662 - languages that derive from Latin, &ldquo;compassion&rdquo; means: we cannot look on coolly as others suffer; or, we sympathize with those who suffer. Another word with approximately the same meaning, &ldquo;pity&rdquo; (French, pitie; Italian, pieta; etc.), connotes a certain condescension towards the sufferer. &ldquo;To take pity on a woman&rdquo; means that we are better off than she, that we stoop to her level, lower ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 667 - To love someone out of compassion means not really to love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 669 - The secret strength of its etymology floods the word with another light and gives it a broader meaning: to have compassion (co-feeling) means not only to be able to live with the other&rsquo;s misfortune but also to feel with him any emotion—joy, anxiety, happiness, pain. This kind of compassion (in the sense of souc/r, wspofczucie, Mitgefuhl, medkansia) therefore signifies the maximal capacity of affective imagination, the art of emotional telepathy. In the hierarchy of sentiments, then, it is supreme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 685 - Anyone who has failed to benefit from the Devil&rsquo;s gift of compassion (co-feeling) will condemn Tereza coldly for her deed, because privacy is sacred and drawers containing intimate correspondence are not to be opened. But because compassion was Tomas&rsquo;s fate (or curse), he felt that he himself had knelt before the open desk drawer, unable to tear his eyes from Sabina&rsquo;s letter. He understood Tereza, and not only was he incapable of being angry with her, he loved her all the more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 693 - But was it still a matter of pleasure? Even as he set out to visit another woman, he found her distasteful and promised himself he would not see her again. He constantly had Tereza&rsquo;s image before his eyes, and the only way he could erase it was by quickly getting drunk. Ever since meeting Tereza, he had been unable to make love to other women without alcohol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 712 - &ldquo;You seem to be turning into the theme of all my paintings,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The meeting of two worlds. A double exposure. Showing through the outline of Tomas the libertine, incredibly, the face of a romantic lover. Or, the other way, through a Tristan, always thinking of his Tereza, I see the beautiful, betrayed world of the libertine.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 733 - He was in a bind: in his mistresses&rsquo; eyes, he bore the stigma of his love for Tereza; in Tereza&rsquo;s eyes, the stigma of his exploits with the mistresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 869 - His love for Tereza was beautiful, but it was also tiring: he had constantly had to hide things from her, sham, dissemble, make amends, buck her up, calm her down, give her evidence of his feelings, play the defendant to her jealousy, her suffering, and her dreams, feel guilty, make excuses and apologies. Now what was tiring had disappeared and only the beauty remained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 895 - On Saturday and Sunday, he felt the sweet lightness of being rise up to him out of the depths of the future. On Monday, he was hit by a weight the likes of which he had never known. The tons of steel of the Russian tanks were nothing compared with it. For there is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even one&rsquo;s own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels with someone, for someone, a pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echoes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 942 - But how long would he have been tortured by compassion? All his life? A year? Or a month? Or only a week?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 986 - It was late at night. His stomach started acting up as it tended to do in times of psychic stress. Once or twice her breathing turned into mild snores. Tomas felt no compassion. All he felt was the pressure in his stomach and the despair of having returned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1021 - The body was a cage, and inside that cage was something which looked, listened, feared, thought, and marveled; that something, that remainder left over after the body had been accounted for, was the soul</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1028 - But just make someone who has fallen in love listen to his stomach rumble, and the unity of body and soul, that lyrical illusion of the age of science, instantly fades away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1042 - Staring at herself for long stretches of time, she was occasionally upset at the sight of her mother&rsquo;s features in her face. She would stare all the more doggedly at her image in an attempt to wish them away and keep only what was hers alone. Each time she succeeded was a time of intoxication: her soul would rise to the surface of her body like a crew charging up from the bowels of a ship, spreading out over the deck, waving at the sky and singing in jubilation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1061 - If a mother was Sacrifice personified, then a daughter was Guilt, with no possibility of redress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1095 - Tereza&rsquo;s mother blew her nose noisily, talked to people in public about her sex life, and enjoyed demonstrating her false teeth. She was remarkably skillful at loosening them with her tongue, and in the midst of a broad smile would cause the uppers to drop down over the lowers in such a way as to give her face a sinister expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1097 - My Note: Amazingly expllins the side character in great detail. The jaws,teeth,sexuality,making daughter feel guilty and stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1099 - Now she had not only lost that modesty, she had radically broken with it, ceremoniously using her new immodesty to draw a dividing line through her life and proclaim that youth and beauty were overrated and worthless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1141 - But is not an event in fact more significant and noteworthy the greater the number of fortuities necessary to bring it about?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1161 - Necessity knows no magic formulae—they are all left to chance. If a love is to be unforgettable, fortuities must immediately start fluttering down to it like birds to Francis of Assisi&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1199 - If the seat Tomas occupied had been occupied instead by the local butcher, Tereza never would have noticed that the radio was playing Beethoven (though the meeting of Beethoven and the butcher would also have been an interesting coincidence). But her nascent love inflamed her sense of beauty, and she would never forget that music. Whenever she heard it, she would be touched. Everything going on around her at that moment would be haloed by the music and take on its beauty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1217 - Without realizing it, the individual composes his life according to the laws of beauty even in times of greatest distress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1243 - ah non, je ne trouvais pas en moi la moindre garantie que je sois meilleur que les autres ; seulement qu’est-ce que ça change dans mes rapports avec autrui ? La conscience de ma propre misère ne me réconcilie nullement avec la misère de mes pareils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1243 - ah non, je ne trouvais pas en moi la moindre garantie que je sois meilleur que les autres ; seulement qu’est-ce que ça change dans mes rapports avec autrui ? La conscience de ma propre misère ne me réconcilie nullement avec la misère de mes pareils. Rien ne me répugne comme lorsque les gens fraternisent parce que chacun voit dans l’autre sa propre bassesse. Je n’ai que faire de cette fraternité visqueuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1272 - The difference between the university graduate and the autodidact lies not so much in the extent of knowledge as in the extent of vitality and self-confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1307 - Your body is just like all other bodies; you have no right to shame; you have no reason to hide something that exists in millions of identical copies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1311 - Theirs was the joyful solidarity of the soulless. The women were pleased at having thrown off the ballast of the soul—that laughable conceit, that illusion of uniqueness—to become one like the next. Tereza sang with them, but did not rejoice. She</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1353 - Anyone whose goal is &ldquo;something higher&rdquo; must expect some day to suffer vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? Then why do we feel it even when the observation tower comes 60 equipped with a sturdy handrail? No, vertigo is something other than the fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1391 - Tereza obeyed Tomas and did not go to visit her mother. Several hours after the decision she fell in the street and injured her knee. She began to teeter as she walked, fell almost daily, bumped into things or, at the very least, dropped objects. She was in the grip of an insuperable longing to fall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1428 - La jeunesse est horrible : c’est une scène où, sur les hauts cothurnes et dans les costumes les plus variés, des enfants s’agitent et profèrent des formules apprises qu’ils comprennent à moitié, mais auxquelles ils tiennent fanatiquement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1467 - The camera served Tereza as both a mechanical eye through which to observe Tomas&rsquo;s mistress and a veil by which to conceal her face from her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1622 - Any man confronted with superior strength is weak, even if he has an athletic body like Dubcek&rsquo;s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1622 - The very weakness that at the time had seemed unbearable and repulsive, the weakness that had driven Tereza and Tomas from the country, suddenly attracted her. She realized that she belonged among the weak, in the camp of the weak, in the country of the weak, and that she had to be faithful to them precisely because they were weak and gasped for breath in the middle of sentences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1626 - She felt attracted by it because she felt weak herself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1628 - &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I want you to be old. Ten years older. Twenty years older!&rdquo; What she meant was: I want you to be weak. As weak as I am.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1665 - In spite of their love, they had made each other&rsquo;s life a hell. The fact that they loved each other was merely proof that the fault lay not in themselves, in their behavior or inconstancy of feeling, but rather in their incompatibility: he was strong and she was weak. She was like Dubcek, who made a thirty-second pause in the middle of a sentence; she was like her country, which stuttered, gasped for breath, could not speak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1681 - He had always been the prime example of everything she loathed. And now all she could think of was looking him up and telling him, &ldquo;You used to say you wanted to sleep with me. Well, here I am.&rdquo; She longed to do something that would prevent her from turning back to Tomas. She longed to destroy brutally the past seven years of her life. It was vertigo. A heady, insuperable longing to fall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1685 - Aware of his weakness, a man decides to give in rather than stand up to it. He is drunk with weakness, wishes to grow even weaker, wishes to fall down in the middle of the main square in front of everybody, wishes to be down, lower than down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1706 - Her first thought was that he had come back because of her; because of her, he had changed his destiny. Now he would no longer be responsible for her; now she was responsible for him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1719 - No, it was not superstition, it was a sense of beauty that cured her of her depression and imbued her with a new will to live. The birds of fortuity had alighted once more on her shoulders. There were tears in her eyes, and she was unutterably happy to hear him breathing at her side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1782 - Immediately he felt relieved and slightly ridiculous. The &ldquo;I prefer Geneva&rdquo; did not mean she refused to make love; quite the contrary, it meant she was tired of limiting their lovemaking to foreign cities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1798 - Each time he lay down next to his wife in that bed, he thought of his mistress imagining him lying down next to his wife in that bed, and each time he thought of her he felt ashamed. That was why he wished to separate the bed he slept in with his wife as far as possible in space from the bed he made love in with his mistress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1858 - The lingerie enhanced the charm of her femininity, while the hard masculine hat denied it, violated and ridiculed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1879 - For this meeting was not a continuation of their erotic rendezvous, each of which had been an opportunity to think up some new little vice; it was a recapitulation of time, a hymn to their common past, a sentimental summary of an unsentimental story that was disappearing in the distance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1882 - The bowler hat was a motif in the musical composition that was Sabina&rsquo;s life. It returned again and again, each time with a different meaning, and all the meanings flowed through the bowler hat like water through a riverbed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1884 - the bowler hat was a bed through which each time Sabina saw another river flow, another semantic river: each time the same object would give rise to a new meaning, though all former meanings would resonate (like an echo, like a parade of echoes) together with the new one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1890 - although they had a clear understanding of the logical meaning of the words they exchanged, they failed to hear the semantic susurrus of the river flowing through them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1924 - He felt himself unworthy of so great a love, and felt he owed her a low bow. He bowed so low that he married her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1927 - It is an interesting formulation. Not &ldquo;respect Marie-Claude,&rdquo; but &ldquo;respect the woman in Marie-Claude.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1930 - He worshipped his mother and not some woman inside her. His mother and the Platonic ideal of womanhood were one and the same</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1952 - Betrayal. From tender youth we are told by father and teacher that betrayal is the most heinous offense imaginable. But what is betrayal? Betrayal means breaking ranks. Betrayal means breaking ranks and going off into the unknown. Sabina knew of nothing more magnificent than going off into the unknown</p>

<p>loc 1972 - But if we betray B., for whom we betrayed A., it does not necessarily follow that we have placated A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1973 - The first betrayal is irreparable. It calls forth a chain reaction of further betrayals, each of which takes us farther and farther away from the point of our original betrayal.</p>

<p>loc 1997 - At the time, she had thought that only in the Communist world could such musical barbarism reign supreme. Abroad, she discovered that the transformation of music into noise was a planetary process by which mankind was entering the historical phase of total ugliness. The total ugliness to come had made itself felt first as omnipresent acoustical ugliness: cars, motorcycles, electric guitars, drills, loudspeakers, sirens. The omnipresence of visual ugliness would soon follow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2009 - Noise has one advantage. It drowns out words.&quot; And suddenly he realized that all his life he had done nothing but talk, write, lecture, concoct sentences, search for formulations and amend them, so in the end no words were precise, their meanings were obliterated, their content lost, they turned into trash, chaff, dust, sand; prowling through his brain, tearing at his head, they were his insomnia, his illness. And what he yearned for at that moment, vaguely but with all his might, was unbounded music, absolute sound, a pleasant and happy all-encompassing, overpowering, window-rattling din to engulf, once and for all, the pain, the futility, the vanity of words. Music was the negation of sentences, music was the anti-word</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2016 - My Note: How the words are misinterpreted is truly explained with such purity and heartfulness. Wow!! Love, sex, music, light, darkness, betrayal and these nuances of ones life. EVERY WORD GIVES A DIFFERENT VIBE TO EACH PERSON. The unconscious gap between Sabina and Franz has been of delight here.</p>

<p>loc 2077 - The only thing they were all able to understand was the flames, the glory of the flames when he was burned at the stake, the glory of the ashes, so for them the essence of being Czech came down to ashes and nothing more. The only things that held them together were their defeats and the reproaches they addressed to one another</p>

<p>loc 2099 - She had an overwhelming desire to tell him, like the most banal of women, Don&rsquo;t let me go, hold me tight, make me your plaything, your slave, be strong! But they were words she could not say. The only thing she said when he released her from his embrace was, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how happy I am to be with you.&rdquo; That was the most her reserved nature allowed her to express.</p>

<p>loc 2171 - appartiennent donc à la même époque de la pensée musicale que celles que l’on chantait dans l’ancienne Grèce. Elles nous conservent les temps de l’Antiquité. 5 Ce soir, en dînant, je n’arrêtais pas de voir les yeux de Ludvik se détournant de moi.</p>

<p>loc 2220 - When the sun goes down, the cemetery sparkles with tiny candles. It looks as though the dead are dancing at a children&rsquo;s ball. Yes, a children&rsquo;s ball, because the dead are as innocent as children. No matter how brutal life becomes, peace always reigns in the cemetery. Even in wartime, in Hitler&rsquo;s time, in Stalin&rsquo;s time, through all occupations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2291 - Franz knew his wife didn&rsquo;t care whether the pendant was ugly or not. An object was ugly if she willed it ugly, beautiful if she willed it beautiful. Pendants worn by her friends were a priori beautiful. And even if she did find them ugly, she would never say so, because flattery had long since become second nature to her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2352 - What she had unexpectedly met there in the village church was not God; it was beauty. She knew perfectly well that neither the church nor the litany was beautiful in and of itself, but they were beautiful compared to the construction site, where she spent her days amid the racket of the songs. The mass was beautiful because it appeared to her in a sudden, mysterious revelation as a world betrayed. From that time on she had known that beauty is a world betrayed. The only way we can encounter it is if its persecutors have overlooked it somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2367 - The great empty space of Amsterdam&rsquo;s Old Church had appeared to him in a sudden and mysterious revelation as the image of his own liberation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2390 - &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ever use your strength on me?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Because love means renouncing strength,&rdquo; said Franz softly. Sabina realized two things: first, that Franz&rsquo;s words were noble and just; second, that they disqualified him from her love life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2460 - Je suis incapable de tenir tête aux plus faibles. Et puisque je fais un mètre quatre-vingt-dix et soulève d’une main un sac de cent kilos, il ne m’est jamais arrivé de rencontrer quelqu’un à qui j’aie pu tenir tête.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2472 - In fact, it was his closed eyes that made Sabina turn out the light. She could not stand those lowered eyelids a moment longer. The eyes, as the saying goes, are windows to the soul. Franz&rsquo;s body, which thrashed about on top of hers with closed eyes, was therefore a body without a soul</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2495 - Each was riding the other like a horse, and both were galloping off into the distance of their desires, drunk on the betrayals that freed them. Franz was riding Sabina and had betrayed his wife; Sabina was riding Franz and had betrayed Franz.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2514 - Even though it facilitated things, he could not help feeling disappointed. He had been afraid of wounding her all his life and voluntarily stuck to a stultifying discipline of monogamy, and now, after twenty years, he suddenly learned that it had all been superfluous and he had given up scores of women because of a misunderstanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2556 - And at some point, he realized to his great surprise that he was not particularly unhappy. Sabina&rsquo;s physical presence was much less important than he had suspected. What was important was the golden footprint, the magic footprint she had left on his life and no one could ever remove. Just before disappearing from his horizon, she had slipped him Hercules&rsquo; broom, and he had used it to sweep everything he despised out of his life. A sudden happiness, a feeling of bliss, the joy that came of freedom and a new life—these were the gifts she had left him.</p>

<p>loc 2566 - young student-mistress. He did not need to squire</p>

<li>
<p>loc 2587 - When we want to give expression to a dramatic situation in our lives, we tend to use metaphors of heaviness. We say that something has become a great burden to us. We either bear the burden or fail and go down with it, we struggle with it, win or 122 lose. And Sabina—what had come over her? Nothing. She had left a man because she felt like leaving him. Had he persecuted her? Had he tried to take revenge on her? No. Her drama was a drama not of heaviness but of lightness. What fell to her lot was not the burden but the unbearable lightness of being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2600 - One could betray one&rsquo;s parents, husband, country, love, but when parents husband, country, and love were gone—what was left to betray? Sabina felt emptiness all around her. What if that emptiness was the goal of all her betrayals?</p>

<p>loc 2606 - Malgré tout mon scepticisme, il m’est resté un peu de superstition irrationnelle, telle cette curieuse conviction que tout événement qui m’advient comporte en plus un sens, qu’il signifie quelque chose ; que par sa propre histoire la vie nous parle, nous révèle graduellement un secret, qu’elle s’offre comme un rébus à déchiffrer, que les histoires que nous vivons forment en même temps une mythologie de notre vie et que cette mythologie détient la clé de la vérité et du mystère. Est-ce une illusion ? C’est possible, c’est même vraisemblable, mais je ne peux réprimer ce besoin de continuellement déchiffrer ma propre vie.</p>

<p>loc 2623 - brothers, sons, or grandmothers buried there,</p>

<p>loc 2630 - She answered herself: When graves are covered with stones, the dead can no longer get out. But the dead can&rsquo;t get out anyway! What difference does it make whether they&rsquo;re covered with soil or stones? 124 The difference is that if a grave is covered with a stone it means we don&rsquo;t want the deceased to come back. The heavy stone tells the deceased, &ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>loc 2651 - Gradually, timorously, their vocabularies would have come together, like bashful lovers, and the music of one would have begun to intersect with the music of the other. But it was too late now</p>

<p>loc 2811 - C’est que les journaux peuvent, à mon sens, se prévaloir d’une circonstance atténuante, et de taille : ils ne sont pas bruyants. Leur futilité demeure silencieuse ; ils ne s’imposent pas ; il est possible de les mettre à la poubelle. Également futile, la radio ne jouit pas de cette circonstance atténuante ; elle nous poursuit au café, au restaurant, voire durant nos visites chez des gens devenus incapables de vivre sans la nourriture ininterrompue des oreilles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2818 - The people of Prague had an inferiority complex with respect to these other cities. Old Town Hall was the only monument of note destroyed in the war, and they decided to leave it in ruins so that no Pole or German could accuse them of having suffered less than their share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2880 - Only the most naive of questions are truly serious. They are the questions with no answers. A question with no answer is a barrier that cannot be breached. In other words, it is questions with no answers that set the limits of human possibilities, describe the boundaries of human existence.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2883 - Tereza stood bewitched before the mirror, staring at her body as if it were alien to her, alien and yet assigned to her and no one else. She felt disgusted by it. It lacked the power to become the only body in Tomas&rsquo;s life. It had disappointed and deceived her. All that night she had had to inhale the aroma of another woman&rsquo;s groin from his hair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2939 - What is flirtation? One might say that it is behavior leading another to believe that sexual intimacy is possible, while preventing that possibility from becoming a certainty. In other words, flirting is a promise of sexual intercourse without a guarantee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2944 - Tomas kept trying to convince her that love and lovemaking were two different things. She refused to understand. Now she was surrounded by men she did not care for in the slightest. What would making love with them be like? She yearned to try it, if only in the form of that no-guarantee promise called flirting. Let there be no mistake: Tereza did not wish to take re- 143 venge on Tomas; she merely wished to find a way out of the maze. She knew that she had become a burden to him: she took things too seriously, turning everything into a tragedy, and failed to grasp the lightness and amusing insignificance of physical love. How she wished she could learn lightness! She yearned for someone to help her out of her anachronistic shell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3018 - &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a petty little drunk. Forget him.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo; The tall man looked in her eyes. &ldquo;Promise?&rdquo; &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; &ldquo;I like hearing you make me promises,&rdquo; he said, still looking in her eyes. The flirtation was on: the behavior leading another to believe that sexual intimacy is possible, even though the possibility itself remains in the realm of theory, in suspense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3175 - Then she felt his hand on her shoulder. The man took the book out of her hand, put it back on the shelf without a word, and led her over to the daybed. Again she recalled the words she had used with the Petrin executioner, and said them aloud: &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t my choice!&rdquo; She believed them to be a miraculous formula that would instantly change the situation, but in that room the words lost their magic power. I have a feeling they even strengthened the man in his resolve: he pressed her to himself and put his hand on her breast. Oddly enough, the touch of his hand immediately erased what remained of her anxiety. For the engineer&rsquo;s hand referred to her body, and she realized that she (her soul) was not at all involved, only her body, her body alone. The body that had betrayed her and that she had sent out into the world among other bodies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3192 - She was nearly immobile while he undressed her. When he kissed her, her lips failed to react. But suddenly she felt her groin becoming moist, and she was afraid. The excitement she felt was all the greater because she was excited against her will. In other words, her soul did condone the proceedings, albeit covertly. But she also knew that if the feeling of excitement was to continue, her soul&rsquo;s approval would have to keep mute. The moment it said its yes aloud, the moment it tried to take an active part in the love scene, the excitement would subside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3197 - Then he pulled off her panties and she was completely naked. When her soul saw her naked body in the arms of a stranger, it was so incredulous that it might as well have been watching the planet Mars at close range. In the light of the incredible, the soul for the first time saw the body as something other than banal; for the first time it looked on the body with fascination: all the body&rsquo;s matchless, inimitable, unique qualities had suddenly come to the fore. This was not the most ordinary of bodies (as the soul had regarded it until then); this was the most extraordinary body. The soul could not tear its eyes away from the body&rsquo;s birthmark, the round brown blemish above its hairy triangle. It looked upon that mark as its seal, a holy seal it had imprinted on the body, and now a stranger&rsquo;s penis was moving blasphemously close to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3292 - Tereza knew what happens during the moment love is born: the woman cannot resist the voice calling forth her terrified soul; the man cannot resist the woman whose soul thus responds to his voice. Tomas had no defense against the lure of love, and Tereza feared for him every minute of every hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3310 - During her next visit to the sauna, she stood before the mirror again and, looking at herself, reviewed the scene of physical love that had taken place in the engineer&rsquo;s flat. It was not her lover she remembered. In fact, she would have been hard put to describe him. She may not even have noticed what he looked like naked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3569 - But, he said to himself, whether they knew or didn&rsquo;t know is not the main issue; the main issue is whether a man is innocent because he didn&rsquo;t know. Is a fool on the throne relieved of all responsibility merely because he is a fool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3596 - Tomas was far from overjoyed. They had considered it necessary to ask him to the editorial offices to approve a change in word order, but then, without asking him, shortened his text by so much that it was reduced to its basic thesis (making it too schematic and aggressive). He didn&rsquo;t like it anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3617 - He knew, all right. There were two things in the balance: his honor (which consisted in his refusing to retract what he had said) and what he had come to call the meaning of his life (his work in medicine and research)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3640 - Tomas was considered the best surgeon in the hospital. Rumor had it that the chief surgeon, who was getting on towards retirement age, would soon ask him to take over. When that rumor 181 was supplemented by the rumor that the authorities had requested a statement of self-criticism from him, no one doubted he would comply. That was the first thing that struck him: although he had never given people cause to doubt his integrity, they were ready to bet on his dishonesty rather than on his virtue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3648 - Ils étaient là une centaine, soit un nombre susceptible de représenter une sorte de micro-modèle d’humanité. Vous n’avez jamais pardonné au genre humain. Depuis lors, vous lui avez retiré votre confiance et lui prodiguez votre haine. Même si je puis vous comprendre, cela ne change rien au fait qu’une pareille haine vouée aux hommes est terrifiante et pécheresse. Elle est devenue votre malédiction. Car vivre dans un monde où nul n’est pardonné, où la rédemption est refusée, c’est comme vivre en enfer. Vous vivez en enfer, Ludvik, et vous me faites pitié.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3651 - My Note: How peoplee would love to see you fall more than reach heights; how we sympathize others for falling much more than we can celebrate someone&rsquo;s joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3684 - And suddenly Tomas grasped a strange fact: everyone was smiling at him, everyone wanted him to write the retraction; it 183 would make everyone happy! The people with the first type of reaction would be happy because by inflating cowardice, he would make their actions seem commonplace and thereby give them back their lost honor. The people with the second type of reaction, who had come to consider their honor a special privilege never to be yielded, nurtured a secret love for the cowards, for without them their courage would soon erode into a trivial, monotonous grind admired by no one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3745 - When you sit face to face with someone who is pleasant, respectful, and polite, you have a hard time reminding yourself that nothing he says is true, that nothing is sincere. Maintaining nonbelief (constantly, systematically, without the slightest vacillation) requires a tremendous 186 effort and the proper training—in other words, frequent police interrogations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3839 - quinze ans je ne l’aie pas du tout reconnue. Depuis longtemps elle était pour</p>

<li>
<p>loc 3888 - People derived too much pleasure from seeing their fellow man morally humiliated to spoil that pleasure by hearing out an explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3911 - Insofar as it is possible to divide people into categories, the surest criterion is the deep-seated desires that orient them to one or another lifelong activity. Every Frenchman is different. But all actors the world over are similar—in Paris, Prague, or the back of beyond. An actor is someone who in early childhood consents to exhibit himself for the rest of his life to an anonymous public. Without that basic consent, which has nothing to do with talent, which goes deeper than talent, no one can become an actor. Similarly, a doctor is someone who consents to spend his life involved with human bodies and all that they entail. That basic consent (and not talent or skill) enables him to enter the dissecting room during the first year of medical school and persevere for the requisite number of years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3927 - God, it may be assumed, took murder into account; He did not take surgery into account. He never suspected that someone would dare to stick his hand into the mechanism He had invented, wrapped carefully in skin, and sealed away from human eyes. When Tomas first positioned his scalpel on the skin of a man asleep under an anesthetic, then breached the skin with a decisive incision, and finally cut it open with a precise and even stroke (as if it were a piece of fabric—a coat, a skirt, a curtain), he experienced a brief but intense feeling of blasphemy. Then again, that was what attracted him to it! That was the &ldquo;Es muss sein!&rdquo; rooted deep inside him, and it was planted there not by chance, not by the chief&rsquo;s sciatica, or by anything external</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3993 - Here he was, doing things he didn&rsquo;t care a damn about, and enjoying it. Now he understood what made people (people he always pitied) happy when they took a job without feeling the compulsion of an internal &ldquo;Es muss sein!&rdquo; and forgot it the moment they left for home every evening. This was the first time he had felt that blissful indifference. Whenever anything went wrong on the operating table, he would be despondent and unable to sleep. He would even lose his taste for women. The &ldquo;Es muss sein!&rdquo; of his profession had been like a vampire sucking his blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4015 - He had reverted to his bachelor existence. Tereza was suddenly out of his life. The only times he saw her were when she came back from the bar late at night and he woke befuddled from a half-sleep, and in the morning, when she was the befuddled one and he was hurrying off to work. Each workday, he had sixteen hours to himself, an unexpected field of freedom. And from Tomas&rsquo;s early youth that had meant women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4040 - What is unique about the &ldquo;I&rdquo; hides itself exactly in what is unimaginable about a person. All we are able to imagine is what makes everyone like everyone else, what people have in common. The individual &ldquo;I&rdquo; is what differs from the common stock, that is, what cannot be guessed at or calculated, what must be unveiled, uncovered, conquered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4058 - We may ask, of course, why he sought that millionth part dissimilarity in sex and nowhere else. Why couldn&rsquo;t he find it, say, in a woman&rsquo;s gait or culinary caprices or artistic taste? To be sure, the millionth part dissimilarity is present in all areas of human existence, but in all areas other than sex it is exposed and needs no one to discover it, needs no scalpel. One woman prefers cheese at the end of the meal, another loathes cauliflower, and although each may demonstrate her originality thereby, it is an originality that demonstrates its own irrelevance and warns us to pay it no heed, to expect nothing of value to come of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4065 - Even today, when conquest time has been drastically cut, sexuality seems still to be a strongbox hiding the mystery of a woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;I.&rdquo;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4226 - The brain appears to possess a special area which we might call poetic memory and which records everything that charms or touches us, that makes our lives beautiful. From the time he met Tereza, no woman had the right to leave the slightest impression on that part of his brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4244 - His adventure with Tereza began at the exact point where his adventures with other women left off. It took place on the other side of the imperative that pushed him into conquest after conquest. He had no desire to uncover anything in Tereza. She had come to him uncovered. He had made love to her before he could grab for the imaginary scalpel he used to open the prostrate body of the world. Before he could start wondering what she would be like when they made love, he loved her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4385 - Je sentis avec épouvante que les choses conçues par erreur sont aussi réelles que les choses conçues par raison et nécessité.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4500 - characters are not born like people, of woman; they are born of a situation, a sentence, a metaphor containing in a nutshell a basic human possibility that the author thinks no one else has discovered or said something essential about</p>

<li>
<p>loc 4505 - The characters in my novels are my own unrealized possibilities. That is why I am equally fond of them all and equally horrified by them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4531 - the Czech estates took courage and vented their ire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4548 - The history of the Czechs and of Europe is a pair of sketches from the pen of mankind&rsquo;s fateful inexperience. History is as light as individual human life, unbearably light, light as a feather, as dust swirling into the air, as whatever will no longer exist tomorrow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4551 - Once more, and with a nostalgia akin to love, Tomas thought of the tall, stooped editor. That man acted as though history were a finished picture rather than a sketch. He acted as though everything he did were to be repeated endlessly, to return eternally, without the slightest doubt about his actions. He was convinced he was right, and for him that was a sign not of narrowmindedness but of virtue. Yes, that man lived in a history different from Tomas&rsquo;s: a history that was not (or did not realize it was) a sketch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4610 - Driving home, Tomas pondered the catastrophic mistake he had made by returning to Prague from Zurich. He kept his eyes trained on the road so as to avoid looking at Tereza. He was furious with her. Her presence at his side felt more unbearably fortuitous than ever. What was she doing here next to him? Who put her in the basket and sent her downstream? Why was his bed chosen as her shore? And why she and not some other woman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4825 - If excitement is a mechanism our Creator uses for His own amusement, love is something that belongs to us alone and enables us to flee the Creator. Love is our freedom. Love lies beyond &ldquo;Es muss sein</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4877 - Let us suppose that such is the case, that somewhere in the world each of us has a partner who once formed part of our body. Tomas&rsquo;s other part is the young woman he dreamed about. The trouble is, man does not find the other part of himself. Instead, he is sent a Tereza in a bulrush basket. But what happens if he nevertheless later meets the one who was meant for him, the other part of himself? Whom is he to prefer? The woman from the bulrush basket or the woman from Plato&rsquo;s myth?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4937 - If rejection and privilege are one and the same, if there is no difference between the sublime and the paltry, if the Son of God can undergo judgment for shit, then human existence loses its dimensions and becomes unbearably light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4949 - Stalin&rsquo;s son laid down his life for shit. But a death for shit is not a senseless death. The Germans who sacrificed their lives to expand their country&rsquo;s territory to the east, the Russians who died to extend their country&rsquo;s power to the west—yes, they died for something idiotic, and their deaths have no meaning or general validity. Amid the general idiocy of the war, the death of Stalin&rsquo;s son stands out as the sole metaphysical death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5012 - &ldquo;Kitsch&rdquo; is a German word born in the middle of the sentimental nineteenth century, and from German it entered all Western languages. Repeated use, however, has obliterated its original metaphysical meaning: kitsch is the absolute denial of shit, in both the literal and the figurative senses of the word; kitsch excludes everything from its purview which is essentially unacceptable in human existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5073 - But whenever a single political movement corners power, we find ourselves in the realm of totalitarian kitsch. When I say &ldquo;totalitarian,&rdquo; what I mean is that everything 252 that infringes on kitsch must be banished for life: every display of individualism (because a deviation from the collective is a spit in the eye of the smiling brotherhood); every doubt (because anyone who starts doubting details will end by doubting life itself); all irony (because in the realm of kitsch everything must be taken quite seriously); and the mother who abandons her family or the man who prefers men to women, thereby calling into question the holy decree &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5086 - In this light, we can regard the gulag as a septic tank used by totalitarian kitsch to dispose of its refuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5101 - The greatest conflict that could occur between two Russians was a lovers&rsquo; misunderstanding: he thought she no longer loved him; she thought he no longer loved her. But in the final scene they would fall into each other&rsquo;s arms, tears of happiness trickling down their cheeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5107 - In the world of the Communist ideal made real, in that world of grinning idiots, she would have nothing to say, she would die of horror within a week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5121 - In the realm of totalitarian kitsch, all answers are given in advance and preclude any questions. It follows, then, that the true opponent of totalitarian kitsch is the person who asks questions. A question is like a knife that slices through the stage backdrop and gives us a look at what lies hidden behind it. In fact, that was exactly how Sabina had explained the meaning of her paintings to Tereza: on the surface, an intelligible lie; underneath, the unintelligible truth showing through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5166 - elsewhere, and from the depths of her being, a silly mawkish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5262 - The interpreter was frightened and did not dare translate what they said. So the twenty Americans on the podium looked on once more with smiles full of good will, many nodding agreement. One of them even lifted his fist in the air because he knew Europeans liked to raise their fists in times of collective euphoria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5343 - Once more they were horrified. Then they timidly ventured a few more looks upward and began to smile slightly. They were filled with a strange pride, a pride they had never known before: the flag they were carrying had been consecrated by blood. Once more they joined the march.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5387 - Franz was right. I can&rsquo;t help thinking about the editor in Prague who organized the petition for the amnesty of political prisoners. He knew perfectly well that his petition would not 268 help the prisoners. His true goal was not to free the prisoners; it was to show that people without fear still exist. That, too, was playacting. But he had no other possibility. His choice was not between playacting and action. His choice was between playacting and no action at all. There are situations in which people are condemned to playact. Their struggle with mute power (the mute power across the river, a police transmogrified into mute microphones in the wall) is the struggle of a theater company that has attacked an army</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5418 - But man can prove nothing of the sort. One pan of the scales held shit; on the other, Stalin&rsquo;s son put his entire body. And the scales did not move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5421 - We can be divided into four categories according to the kind of look we wish to live under. The first category longs for the look of an infinite number of anonymous eyes, in other words, for the look of the public. That is the case with the German singer, the American actress, and even the tall, stooped editor with the big chin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5435 - The second category is made up of people who have a vital need to be looked at by many known eyes. They are the tireless hosts of cocktail parties and dinners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5439 - there is the third category, the category of people who need to be constantly before the eyes of the person they love. Their situation is as dangerous as the situation of people in the first category. One day the eyes of their beloved will close, and the room will go dark. Tereza and Tomas belong in the third category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5442 - there is the fourth category, the rarest, the category of people who live in the imaginary eyes of those who are not present. They are the dreamers. Franz, for example. He traveled to the borders of Cambodia only for Sabina. As the bus bumped along the Thai road, he could feel her eyes fixed on him in a long stare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5480 - At about that time, he learned about a woman who had once been his father&rsquo;s mistress and was living in France. He found out her address. Because he desperately needed an imaginary eye to follow his life, he would occasionally write her long letters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5512 - All at once, the Cambodia venture struck him as meaningless, laughable. Why had he come? Only now did he know. He had come to find out once and for all that neither parades nor Sabina but rather the girl with the glasses was his real life, his only real life! He had come to find out that reality was more than a dream, much more than a dream</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5651 - Perhaps it was the fact that no one wished to settle there that caused the state to lose its power over the countryside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5711 - The very beginning of Genesis tells us that God created man in order to give him dominion over fish and fowl and all creatures. Of course, Genesis was written by a man, not a horse. There is no certainty that God actually did grant man dominion over other creatures. What seems more likely, in fact, is that man invented God to sanctify the dominion that he had usurped for himself over the cow and the horse. Yes, the right to kill a deer or a cow is the only thing all of mankind can agree upon, even during the bloodiest of wars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5738 - With a sad smile, she told herself that she needed to hide it more than she would an affair. People are indignant at the thought of someone loving a dog. But if the neighbor had discovered that Tereza had been unfaithful to Tomas, she would have given Tereza a playful pat on the back as a sign of secret solidarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5788 - True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power. Mankind&rsquo;s true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5789 - My Note: Powerful words</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5909 - Tomas tiptoed into the room where Karenin was lying, but she would not leave him alone with the dog. They both leaned over him, each from his own side. Not that there was a hint of reconciliation in the move. Quite the contrary. Each of them was alone. Tereza with her dog, Tomas with his.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5932 - The longing for Paradise is man&rsquo;s longing not to be man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5945 - Why is it that a dog&rsquo;s menstruation made her lighthearted and gay, while her own menstruation made her squeamish?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5945 - Why is it that a dog&rsquo;s menstruation made her lighthearted and gay, while her own menstruation made her squeamish? The answer seems simple to me: dogs were never expelled from Paradise. Karenin knew nothing about the duality of body and soul and had no concept of disgust. That is why Tereza felt so free and easy with him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5954 - It is a completely selfless love: Tereza did not want anything of Karenin; she did not ever ask him to love her back. Nor had she ever asked herself the questions that plague human couples: Does he love me? Does he love anyone more than me? Does he love me more than I love him? Perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, test, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. Perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company. And something else: Tereza accepted Karenin for what he was; she did not try to make him over in her image; she agreed 298 from the outset with his dog&rsquo;s life, did not wish to deprive him of it, did not envy him his secret intrigues. The reason she trained him was not to transform him (as a husband tries to reform his wife and a wife her husband), but to provide him with the elementary language that enabled them to communicate and live together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5974 - But most of all: No one can give anyone else the gift of the idyll; only an animal can do so, because only animals were not expelled from Paradise. The love between dog and man is idyllic. It knows no conflicts, no hair-raising scenes; it knows no development. Karenin surrounded Tereza and Tomas with a life based on repetition, and he expected the same from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5998 - Assuming the role of Death is a terrifying thing. Tomas insisted that he would not give the injection himself; he would have the vet come and do it. But then he realized that he could grant Karenin a privilege forbidden to humans: Death would 300 come for him in the guise of his loved ones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 6206 - she had really loved Tomas with a great love, she would have stuck it out with him abroad! Tomas had been happy there; a new life was opening for him! And she had left him! True, at the time she had convinced herself she was being magnanimous, giving him his 310 freedom. But hadn&rsquo;t her magnanimity been merely an excuse? She knew all along that he would come home to her! She had summoned him farther and farther down after her like the nymphs who lured unsuspecting villagers to the marshes and left them there to drown. She had taken advantage of a night of stomach cramps to inveigle him into moving to the country! How cunning she could be! She had summoned him to follow her as if wishing to test him again and again, to test his love for her; she had summoned him persistently, and here he was, tired and gray, with stiffened fingers that would never again be capable of holding a scalpel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 6221 - Good God, had they had to cover all that distance just to make her believe he loved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 6224 - We all have a tendency to consider strength the culprit and weakness the innocent victim. But now Tereza realized that in her case the opposite was true! Even her dreams, as if aware of the single weakness in a man otherwise strong, made a display of her suffering to him, thereby forcing him to retreat. Her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 6287 - There was no doubting that forthright voice of his. She recalled the scene she had witnessed earlier in the day when he had been repairing the pickup and looked so old. She had reached her goal: she had always wanted him to be old. Again she thought of the rabbit she had pressed to her face in her childhood room. What does it mean to turn into a rabbit? It means losing all strength. It means that one is no stronger than the other anymore.</p>
