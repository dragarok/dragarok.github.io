<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 132 - The sillier the market’s behavior, the greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. Follow Graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 219 - No statement is more true and better applicable to Wall Street than the famous warning of Santayana: “Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 289 - We have some doubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is promised to the active investor under today’s conditions. But next year or the years after may well be different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 312 - Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors. The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating on the most promising companies in the most promising industries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 421 - As Graham puts it, “while enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 441 - Graham’s sober words of warning: “Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 441 - Graham’s sober words of warning: “Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.” While it seems easy to foresee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real value if most other investors are already expecting the same thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 453 - The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky, not less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their prices fall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks more costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep enough cash on hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a bear market, since it puts stocks back on sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 467 - “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 509 - There is intelligent speculation as there is intelligent investing. But there are many ways in which speculation may be unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1) speculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seriously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 518 - Never mingle your speculative and investment operations in the same account, nor in any part of your thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 535 - The half and half division between bonds and stocks would yield about 6% before income tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 621 - We shall repeat here without apology—for the warning cannot be given too often—that the investor cannot hope for better than average results by buying new offerings, or “hot” issues of any sort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 621 - We shall repeat here without apology—for the warning cannot be given too often—that the investor cannot hope for better than average results by buying new offerings, or “hot” issues of any sort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit.† The contrary is almost certain to be true in the long run. The defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 624 - The defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 639 - It is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy, study, and native ability into Wall Street and to end up with losses instead of profits. These virtues, if channeled in the wrong directions, become indistinguishable from handicaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 671 - To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average results, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently sound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 709 - The enterprising investor under today’s conditions still has various possibilities of achieving better than average results. The huge list of marketable securities must include a fair number that can be identified as undervalued by logical and reasonably dependable standards. These should yield more satisfactory results on the average than will the DJIA or any similarly representative list. In our view the search for these would not be worth the investor’s effort unless he could hope to add, say, 5% before taxes to the average annual return from the stock portion of his portfolio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 723 - Note that investing, according to Graham, consists equally of three elements: you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its underlying businesses, before you buy its stock; you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses; you must aspire to “adequate,” not extraordinary, performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 731 - Graham urges you to invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 748 - To see why temporarily high returns don’t prove anything, imagine that two places are 130 miles apart. If I observe the 65-mph speed limit, I can drive that distance in two hours. But if I drive 130 mph, I can get there in one hour. If I try this and survive, am I “right”? Should you be tempted to try it, too, because you hear me bragging that it “worked”?</p>
</li>

<p>loc 748 - To see why temporarily high returns don’t prove anything, imagine that two places are 130 miles apart. If I observe the 65-mph speed limit, I can drive that distance in two hours. But if I drive 130 mph, I can get there in one hour. If I try this and survive, am I “right”? Should you be tempted to try it, too, because you hear me bragging that it “worked”? Flashy gimmicks for beating the market are much the same: In short streaks, so long as your luck holds out, they work. Over time, they will get you killed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 810 - Throughout the past decade or so, one speculative formula after another was promoted, popularized, and then thrown aside. All of them shared a few traits—This is quick! This is easy! And it won’t hurt a bit!—and all of them violated at least one of Graham’s distinctions between investing and speculating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 887 - Never mingle the money in your speculative account with what’s in your investment accounts; never allow your speculative thinking to spill over into your investing activities; and never put more than 10% of your assets into your mad money account, no matter what happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 993 - All of the above brings us back to our conclusion that the investor has no sound basis for expecting more than an average overall return of, say, 8% on a portfolio of DJIA-type common stocks purchased at the late 1971 price level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 996 - If there is one thing guaranteed for the future, it is that the earnings and average annual market value of a stock portfolio will not grow at the uniform rate of 4%, or any other figure. In the memorable words of the elder J. P. Morgan, “They will fluctuate.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1028 - We think strongly that the risks involved in buying, say, a telephone-company bond at yields of nearly 7½% are much less than those involved in buying the DJIA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1030 - But the possibility of large-scale inflation remains, and the investor must carry some insurance against it. There is no certainty that a stock component will insure adequately against such inflation, but it should carry more protection than the bond component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1049 - If you receive a 2% raise in a year when inflation runs at 4%, you will almost certainly feel better than you will if you take a 2% pay cut during a year when inflation is zero. Yet both changes in your salary leave you in a virtually identical position—2% worse off after inflation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1054 - investors were delighted to earn 11% on bank certificates of deposit (CDs) in 1980 and are bitterly disappointed to be earning only around 2% in 2003—even though they were losing money after inflation back then but are keeping up with inflation now. The nominal rate we earn is printed in the bank’s ads and posted in its window, where a high number makes us feel good. But inflation eats away at that high number in secret. Instead of taking out ads, inflation just takes away our wealth. That’s why inflation is so easy to overlook—and why it’s so important to measure your investing success not just by what you make, but by how much you keep after inflation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1090 - Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs (pronounced “reets”), are companies that own and collect rent from commercial and residential properties.10 Bundled into real-estate mutual funds, REITs do a decent job of combating inflation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1096 - Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are U.S. government bonds, first issued in 1997, that automatically go up in value when inflation rises. Because the full faith and credit of the United States stands behind them, all Treasury bonds are safe from the risk of default (or nonpayment of interest).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1101 - When the value of your TIPS bond rises as inflation heats up, the Internal Revenue Service regards that increase in value as taxable income—even though it is purely a paper gain (unless you sold the bond at its newly higher price).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1104 - TIPS are best suited for a tax-deferred retirement account like an IRA, Keogh, or 401(k), where they will not jack up your taxable income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1289 - The heart of Graham’s argument is that the intelligent investor must never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1305 - Lehman Brothers, asked rhetorically: “Is the stock market riskier today than two years ago simply because prices are higher? The answer is no.” But the answer is yes. It always has been. It always will be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1357 - Graham’s warning in this chapter is simple: “By the rule of opposites,” the more enthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run, the more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1375 - Shiller compares the current price of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index against average corporate profits over the past 10 years (after inflation). By scanning the historical record, Shiller has shown that when his ratio goes well above 20, the market usually delivers poor returns afterward; when it drops well below 10, stocks typically produce handsome gains down the road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1393 - The only thing you can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that you will probably turn out to be wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1409 - there has developed the general notion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is more or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run. Our view is different. The rate of return sought should be dependent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring to bear on his task</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1412 - “In many cases there may be less real risk associated with buying a ‘bargain issue’ offering the chance of a large profit than with a conventional bond purchase yielding about 4½%.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1469 - (The term “municipals” is generally applied to all species of tax-exempt bonds, including state obligations.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1616 - investments you own than on what kind of investor you are. There are two ways to be an intelligent investor: by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds; or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1670 - Let’s say you are comfortable with a fairly high level of risk—say, 70% of your assets in stocks and 30% in bonds. If the stock market rises 25% (but bonds stay steady), you will now have just under 75% in stocks and only 25% in bonds.5 Visit your 401(k)’s website (or call its toll-free number) and sell enough of your stock funds to “rebalance” back to your 70–30 target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1691 - Taxable or tax-free? Unless you’re in the lowest tax bracket,6 you should buy only tax-free (municipal) bonds outside your retirement accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1696 - Short-term or long-term? Bonds and interest rates teeter on opposite ends of a seesaw: If interest rates rise, bond prices fall—although a short-term bond falls far less than a long-term bond. On the other hand, if interest rates fall, bond prices rise—and a long-term bond will outper-forms shorter ones.8 You can split the difference simply by buying intermediate-term bonds maturing in five to 10 years—which do not soar when their side of the seesaw rises, but do not slam into the ground either. For most investors, intermediate bonds are the simplest choice, since they enable you to get out of the game of guessing what interest rates will do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1701 - For most investors, intermediate bonds are the simplest choice, since they enable you to get out of the game of guessing what interest rates will do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1702 - bonds are generally sold in $10,000 lots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1706 - For most investors, bond funds beat individual bonds hands down (the main exceptions are Treasury securities and some municipal bonds).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1716 - Treasury securities, as obligations of the U.S. government, carry virtually no credit risk—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1718 - Because of their very short maturities, T-bills barely get dented when rising interest rates knock down the prices of other income investments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1719 - The interest income on Treasury securities is generally free from state (but not Federal) income tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1730 - Savings bonds, unlike Treasuries, are not marketable; you cannot sell them to another investor, and you’ll forfeit three months of interest if you redeem them in less than five years. Thus they are suitable mainly as “set-aside money” to meet a future spending need—a gift for a religious ceremony that’s years away, or a jump start on putting your newborn through Harvard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1736 - Mortgage securities. Pooled together from thousands of mortgages around the United States, these bonds are issued by agencies like the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1736 - Mortgage securities. Pooled together from thousands of mortgages around the United States, these bonds are issued by agencies like the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). However, they are not backed by the U.S. Treasury, so they sell at higher yields to reflect their greater risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1738 - they are not backed by the U.S. Treasury, so they sell at higher yields to reflect their greater risk. Mortgage bonds generally underperform when interest rates fall and bomb when rates rise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1741 - if a broker ever tries to sell you an individual mortgage bond or “CMO,” tell him you are late for an appointment with your proctologist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1742 - Annuities. These insurance-like investments enable you to defer current taxes and capture a stream of income after you retire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1746 - if an annuity produces fat commissions for the seller, chances are it will produce meager results for the buyer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1749 - Preferred shares are a worst-of-both-worlds investment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1757 - No intelligent investor, no matter how starved for yield, would ever buy a stock for its dividend income alone; the company and its businesses must be solid, and its stock price must be reasonable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1934 - Human felicity is produc’d not so much by great Pieces of good Fortune that seldom happen, as by little Advantages that occur every day. —Benjamin Franklin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1943 - “After you burn your mouth on hot milk, you blow on your yogurt.” Because the crash of 2000–2002 was so terrible, many investors now view stocks as scaldingly risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of crashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market. It was hot milk before, but it is room-temperature yogurt now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1965 - Lynch’s rule—“You can outper-forms the experts if you use your edge by investing in companies or industries you already understand”—isn’t totally implausible, and thousands of investors have profited from it over the years. But Lynch’s rule can work only if you follow its corollary as well: “Finding the promising company is only the first step. The next step is doing the research.” To his credit, Lynch insists that no one should ever invest in a company, no matter how great its products or how crowded its parking lot, without studying its financial statements and estimating its business value. Unfortunately, most stock buyers have ignored that part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1981 - Sadly, the employees of Enron, Global Crossing, and WorldCom—many of whom put nearly all their retirement assets in their own company’s stock, only to be wiped out—learned that insiders often possess only the illusion of knowledge, not the real thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1981 - Sadly, the employees of Enron, Global Crossing, and WorldCom—many of whom put nearly all their retirement assets in their own company’s stock, only to be wiped out—learned that insiders often possess only the illusion of knowledge, not the real thing. Psychologists led by Baruch Fischhoff of Carnegie Mellon University have documented a disturbing fact: becoming more familiar with a subject does not significantly reduce people’s tendency to exaggerate how much they actually know about it.3 That’s why “investing in what you know” can be so dangerous; the more you know going in, the less likely you are to probe a stock for weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2013 - Be warned, however, that buying stocks in tiny increments for years on end can set off big tax headaches. If you are not prepared to keep a permanent and exhaustively detailed record of your purchases, do not buy in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2027 - You, and no one but you, must investigate (before you hand over your money) whether an adviser is trustworthy and charges reasonable fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2031 - In their finest form—index portfolios—mutual funds can require virtually no monitoring or maintenance whatsoever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2042 - The ideal way to dollar-cost average is into a portfolio of index funds, which own every stock or bond worth having. That way, you renounce not only the guessing game of where the market is going but which sectors of the market—and which particular stocks or bonds within them—will do the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2051 - According to Ibbotson Associates, the leading financial research firm, if you had invested $12,000 in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index at the beginning of September 1929, 10 years later you would have had only $7,223 left. But if you had started with a paltry $100 and simply invested another $100 every single month, then by August 1939, your money would have grown to $15,571! That’s the power of disciplined buying—even in the face of the Great Depression and the worst bear market of all time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2056 - Best of all, once you build a permanent autopilot portfolio with index funds as its heart and core, you’ll be able to answer every market question with the most powerful response a defensive investor could ever have: “I don’t know and I don’t care.” If someone asks whether bonds will outper-forms stocks, just answer, “I don’t know and I don’t care”—after all, you’re automatically buying both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2253 - High-yield bonds—which Graham calls “second-grade” or “lower-grade” and today are called “junk bonds”—get a brisk thumbs-down from Graham.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2260 - Since 1978, an annual average of 4.4% of the junk-bond market has gone into default—but, even after those defaults, junk bonds have still produced an annualized return of 10.5%, versus 8.6% for 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds.2 Unfortunately, most junk-bond funds charge high fees and do a poor job of preserving the original principal amount of your investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2289 - Graham considered foreign bonds no better a bet than junk bonds.3Today, however, one variety of foreign bond may have some appeal for investors who can withstand plenty of risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2297 - day trading—holding stocks for a few hours at a time—is one of the best weapons ever invented for committing financial suicide. Some of your trades might make money, most of your trades will lose money, but your broker will always make money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2309 - Add it all up, and a stock trader needs to gain at least 10% just to break even on buying and selling a stock.6 Anyone can do that once, by luck alone. To do it often enough to justify the obsessive attention it requires—plus the nightmarish stress it generates—is impossible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2322 - “long-term investor” is redundant. A long-term investor is the only kind of investor there is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2357 - More important, buying IPOs is a bad idea because it flagrantly violates one of Graham’s most fundamental rules: No matter how many other people want to buy a stock, you should buy only if the stock is a cheap way to own a desirable business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2710 - It requires a great deal of boldness and a great deal of caution to make a great fortune; and when you have got it, it requires ten times as much wit to keep it. —Nathan Mayer Rothschild</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2712 - Timing is Nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2729 - if you had followed the recommendations of the best 10% of all market-timing newsletters, you would have earned a 12.6% annualized return from 1991 through 1995. But if you had ignored them and kept your money in a stock index fund, you would have earned 16.4%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2734 - market timing is a practical and emotional impossibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2743 - A great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for the stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2743 - A great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for the stock. The more a stock has gone up, the more it seems likely to keep going up. But that instinctive belief is flatly contradicted by a fundamental law of financial physics: The bigger they get, the slower they grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2745 - The bigger they get, the slower they grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2760 - The intelligent investor, however, gets interested in big growth stocks not when they are at their most popular—but when something goes wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2790 - The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans, for example, has been dominated by undiversified fortunes ever since it was first compiled in 1982. However, almost no small fortunes have been made this way—and not many big fortunes have been kept this way. What Carnegie neglected to mention is that concentration also makes most of the great failures of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2819 - Investing in foreign stocks may not be mandatory for the intelligent investor, but it is definitely advisable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2827 - It’s not that you should never invest in foreign markets like Japan; it’s that the Japanese should never have kept all their money at home. And neither should you. If you live in the United States, work in the United States, and get paid in U.S. dollars, you are already making a multilayered bet on the U.S. economy. To be prudent, you should put some of your investment portfolio elsewhere—simply because no one, anywhere, can ever know what the future will bring at home or abroad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3199 - The manic-depressive Mr. Market does not always price stocks the way an appraiser or a private buyer would value a business. Instead, when stocks are going up, he happily pays more than their objective value; and, when they are going down, he is desperate to dump them for less than their true worth. Is Mr. Market still around? Is he still bipolar? You bet he is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3231 - The intelligent investor shouldn’t ignore Mr. Market entirely. Instead, you should do business with him—but only to the extent that it serves your interests. Mr. Market’s job is to provide you with prices; your job is to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them. You do not have to trade with him just because he constantly begs you to. By refusing to let Mr. Market be your master, you transform him into your servant. After all, even when he seems to be destroying values, he is creating them elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3246 - One of Graham’s most powerful insights is this: “The investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage.” What does Graham mean by those words “basic advantage”? He means that the intelligent individual investor has the full freedom to choose whether or not to follow Mr. Market. You have the luxury of being able to think for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3278 - If you listen to financial TV, or read most market columnists, you’d think that investing is some kind of sport, or a war, or a struggle for survival in a hostile wilderness. But investing isn’t about beating others at their game. It’s about controlling yourself at your own game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3360 - The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your realized losses (any declines in value that you lock in by selling your shares) to offset up to $3,000 in ordinary income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3365 - Before 2002 ended, you could have sold all your Coke shares, locking in the $3,200 loss. Then, after waiting 31 days to comply with IRS rules, you would buy 200 shares of Coke all over again. The result: You would be able to reduce your taxable income by $3,000 in 2002, and you could use the remaining $200 loss to offset your income in 2003. And better yet, you would still own a company whose future you believe in—but now you would own it for almost one-third less than you paid the first time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3601 - mutual funds aren’t perfect; they are almost perfect, and that word makes all the difference. Because of their imperfections, most funds underperform the market, overcharge their investors, create tax headaches, and suffer erratic swings in performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3613 - This is yet another reminder that the market’s hottest market sector—in 1999, that was technology—often turns as cold as liquid nitrogen, with blinding speed and utterly no warning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3631 - When a stock picker seems to have the Midas touch, everyone wants him—including rival fund companies. If you bought Transamerica Premier Equity Fund to cash in on the skills of Glen Bickerstaff, who gained 47.5% in 1997, you were quickly out of luck; TCW snatched him away in mid-1998 to run its TCW Galileo Select Equities Fund, and the Transamerica fund lagged the market in three of the next four years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3638 - When a fund earns high returns, investors notice—often pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of weeks. That leaves the fund manager with few choices—all of them bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3654 - It often costs more to trade stocks in very large blocks than in small ones; with fewer buyers and sellers, it’s harder to make a match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3660 - As a fund grows, its fees become more lucrative—making its managers reluctant to rock the boat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3679 - recognize that an index fund—which owns all the stocks in the market, all the time, without any pretense of being able to select the “best” and avoid the “worst”—will beat most funds over the long run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3686 - Index funds have only one significant flaw: They are boring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3692 - Late in his life, Graham praised index funds as the best choice for individual investors, as does Warren Buffett.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3698 - At Longleaf and other firms like Davis and FPA, the managers own so much of the funds that they are likely to manage your money as if it were their own—lowering the odds that they will jack up fees, let the funds swell to gargantuan size, or whack you with a nasty tax bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3702 - One of the most common myths in the fund business is that “you get what you pay for”—that high returns are the best justification for higher fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3712 - The best funds often close to new investors—permitting only their existing shareholders to buy more. That stops the feeding frenzy of new buyers who want to pile in at the top and protects the fund from the pains of asset elephantiasis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3717 - They don’t advertise. Just as Plato says in The Republic that the ideal rulers are those who do not want to govern, the best fund managers often behave as if they don’t want your money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3721 - Most fund buyers look at past performance first, then at the manager’s reputation, then at the riskiness of the fund, and finally (if ever) at the fund’s expenses.8 The intelligent investor looks at those same things—but in the opposite order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3734 - Five-star funds, in fact, have a disconcerting habit of going on to underperform one-star funds. So first find a low-cost fund whose managers are major shareholders, dare to be different, don’t hype their returns, and have shown a willingness to shut down before they get too big for their britches. Then, and only then, consult their Morningstar rating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3789 - If you’re not prepared to stick with a fund through at least three lean years, you shouldn’t buy it in the first place. Patience is the fund investor’s single most powerful ally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4096 - In screening an adviser, your goals should be to: determine whether he or she cares about helping clients, or just goes through the motions establish whether he or she understands the fundamental principles of investing as they are outlined in this book assess whether he or she is sufficiently educated, trained, and experienced to help you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4136 - “You hire an adviser,” explains commentator Nick Murray, “not to manage money but to manage you.” “If the adviser is a line of defense between you and your worst impulsive tendencies,” says financial-planning analyst Robert Veres, “then he or she should have systems in place that will help the two of you control them.” Among those systems: a comprehensive financial plan that outlines how you will earn, save, spend, borrow, and invest your money; an investment policy statement that spells out your fundamental approach to investing; an asset-allocation plan that details how much money you will keep in different investment categories. These are the building blocks on which good financial decisions must be founded, and they should be created mutually—by you and the adviser—rather than imposed unilaterally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4430 - What makes one company worth 10 times earnings and another worth 20 times? How can you be reasonably sure that you are not overpaying for an apparently rosy future that turns out to be a murky nightmare? Graham feels that five elements are decisive.1 He summarizes them as: the company’s “general long-term prospects” the quality of its management its financial strength and capital structure its dividend record and its current dividend rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4441 - An average of more than two or three acquisitions a year is a sign of potential trouble. After all, if the company itself would rather buy the stock of other businesses than invest in its own, shouldn’t you take the hint and look elsewhere too?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4457 - Several forces can widen a company’s moat: a strong brand identity (think of Harley Davidson, whose buyers tattoo the company’s logo onto their bodies); a monopoly or near-monopoly on the market; economies of scale, or the ability to supply huge amounts of goods or services cheaply (consider Gillette, which churns out razor blades by the billion); a unique intangible asset (think of Coca-Cola, whose secret formula for flavored syrup has no real physical value but maintains a priceless hold on consumers); a resistance to substitution (most businesses have no alternative to electricity, so utility companies are unlikely to be supplanted any time soon).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4486 - If a company reprices (or “reissues” or “exchanges”) its stock options for insiders, stay away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4538 - Companies that repeatedly split their shares—and hype those splits in breathless press releases—treat their investors like dolts. Like Yogi Berra, who wanted his pizza cut into four slices because “I don’t think I can eat eight,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4745 - In short, pro forma earnings enable companies to show how well they might have done if they hadn’t done as badly as they did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4806 - When you research a company’s financial reports, start reading on the last page and slowly work your way toward the front. Anything that the company doesn’t want you to find is buried in the back—which is precisely why you should look there first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4809 - Read the notes.Never buy a stock without reading the footnotes to the financial statements in the annual report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4818 - If you are an enterprising investor willing to put plenty of time and energy into your portfolio, then you owe it to yourself to learn more about financial reporting. That’s the only way to minimize your odds of being misled by a shifty earnings statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4818 - If you are an enterprising investor willing to put plenty of time and energy into your portfolio, then you owe it to yourself to learn more about financial reporting. That’s the only way to minimize your odds of being misled by a shifty earnings statement. Three solid books full of timely and specific examples are Martin Fridson and Fernando Alvarez’s Financial Statement Analysis, Charles Mulford and Eugene Comiskey’s The Financial Numbers Game, and Howard Schilit’s Financial Shenanigans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5238 - A low-cost index fund is the best tool ever created for low-maintenance stock investing—and any effort to improve on it takes more work (and incurs more risk and higher costs) than a truly defensive investor can justify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5288 - you should realize that a defensive investor can always prosper by looking patiently and calmly through the wreckage of a bear market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5291 - The best values today are often found in the stocks that were once hot and have since gone cold.</p>
