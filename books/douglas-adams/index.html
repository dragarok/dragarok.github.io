<p>loc 1038 - “Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1238 - “Space,” it says, “is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that’s just peanuts to space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1455 - Marvin regarded it with cold loathing while his logic circuits chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence against it. Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? What’s the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in. Further circuits amused themselves by analyzing the molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids’ brain cells. For a quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom. A spasm of despair shook the robot’s body as he turned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2185 - It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2226 - The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very very very big, so big that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2337 - “O Deep Thought computer,” he said, “the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us …” he paused, “the Answer!” “The Answer?” said Deep Thought. “The Answer to what?” “Life!” urged Fook. “The Universe!” said Lunkwill. “Everything!” they said in chorus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2458 - “You’re really not going to like it,” observed Deep Thought. “Tell us!” “All right,” said Deep Thought. “The Answer to the Great Question …” “Yes …!” “Of Life, the Universe and Everything …” said Deep Thought. “Yes …!” “Is …” said Deep Thought, and paused. “Yes …!” “Is …” “Yes …!!! …?” “Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2461 - “Is …” said Deep Thought, and paused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2463 - “Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2632 - Here,” he said, hoicking out a lump of evil-smelling meat from a bowl, “have some Vegan Rhino’s cutlet. It’s delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2884 - In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3318 - said “The Guide is definitive. Reality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3318 - “The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3722 - Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who are hurled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3830 - He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity around him—everything. And with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4207 - The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the stage, while the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet—or more frequently around a completely different planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4300 - choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good,” it said. “I’ll just nip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5254 - it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5254 - To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem.</p>
