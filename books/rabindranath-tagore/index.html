                <p>### Author: Rabindranath Tagore</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 208 - Indeed, when he is speaking of children, so much a part of himself this quality seems, one is not certain that he is not also speaking of the saints, “They build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds. They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 283 - Mother, it is no gain, thy bondage of finery, if it keep one shut off from the healthful dust of the earth, if it rob one of the right of entrance to the great fair of common human life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 298 - When I try to bow to thee, my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth where thy feet rest among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 308 - He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the pathmaker is breaking stones. He is with them in sun and in shower, and his garment is covered with dust. Put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 321 - The traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 387 - If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its head bent low with patience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 469 - Obstinate are the trammels, but my heart aches when I try to break them. Freedom is all I want, but to hope for it I feel ashamed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 473 - My debts are large, my failures great, my shame secret and heavy; yet when I come to ask for my good, I quake in fear lest my prayer be granted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 487 - I came out alone on my way to my tryst. But who is this that follows me in the silent dark? I move aside to avoid his presence but I escape him not. He makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger; he adds his loud voice to every word that I utter. He is my own little self, my lord, he known no shame; but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 496 - “Prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?” “It was my master,” said the prisoner. “I thought I could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power, and I amassed in my own treasure-house the money due to my king. When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bed that was for my lord, and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 501 - Thus night and day I worked at the chain with huge fires and cruel hard strokes. When at last the work was done and the links were complete and unbreakable, I found that it held me in its grip.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 533 - Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action – Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake. Chapter 36 This is my prayer to thee, my lord – strike, strike at the root of penury in my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 533 - Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action – Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 547 - Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might. Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles. And give me the strength to surrender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 547 - Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might. Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles. And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 548 - Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles. And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love. Chapter 37 I thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my power, – that the path before me was closed, that provisions were exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 556 - And when old words die out on the tongue, new melodies break forth from the heart; and where the old tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 565 - As the storm still seeks its end in peace when it strikes against peace with all its might, even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love and still its cry is – “I want thee, only thee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 571 - When the heart is hard and parched up, come upon me with a shower of mercy. When grace is lost from life, come with a burst of song. When tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from beyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest. When my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner, break open the door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king. When desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, O thou holy one, thou wakeful, come with thy light and thy thunder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 585 - Let the cloud of grace bend low from above like the tearful look of the mother on the day of the father’s wrath.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 593 - The morning time is past, and the noon. In the shade of evening my eyes are drowsy with sleep. Men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame. I sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face, and when they ask me what it is I want, I drop my eyes and answer them not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 617 - The day was when I did not keep myself in readiness for thee; and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a fleeting moment of my life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 658 - If the sound of his steps does not wake me, do not try to rouse me, I pray. I wish not to be called from my sleep by the clamorous choir, of birds, by the riot of wind at the festival of morning light. Let me sleep undisturbed even if my lord comes of a sudden to my door</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 672 - Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, and I laid myself down by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass. My companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 676 - Mockery and reproach pricked me ro rise, but found no response in me. I gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation – in the shadow of a dim delight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 686 - You came down from your throne and stood at my cottage door. I was singing and alone in a corner, and the melody caught your ear. You came down and stood at my cottage door. Masters are many in your hall, and songs are sung there at all hours. But the simple carol of this novice struck at your love. One plaintive little strain mingled with the great music of the world, and with a flower for a prize you came down and stopped at my cottage door.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 730 - sit and muse in wonder, what gift is this of thine. I can find no place where to hide it. I am ashamed to wear it, frail as I am, and it hurts me when I press it to my bosom. Yet shall I bear in my heart this honour of the burden of pain, this gift of thine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 860 - On the slope of the desolate river among tall grasses I asked her, “Maiden, where do you go, shading your lamp with your mantle? Me house is all dark and lonesome, – lend me your light!” She raised her dark eyes for a moment and looked at my face through the dusk. “I have come to the river,” she said, “to float my lamp on the stream when the daylight wanes in the west.” I stood alone among tall grasses and watched the timid flame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 860 - On the slope of the desolate river among tall grasses I asked her, “Maiden, where do you go, shading your lamp with your mantle? Me house is all dark and lonesome, – lend me your light!” She raised her dark eyes for a moment and looked at my face through the dusk. “I have come to the river,” she said, “to float my lamp on the stream when the daylight wanes in the west.” I stood alone among tall grasses and watched the timid flame of her lamp uselessly drifting in the tide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 899 - But there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no day nor night, nor form nor colour, and never, never a word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 955 - Deliverance is not for me in renunciation. I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 958 - No, I will never shut the doors of my senses. The delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight. Yes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy, and all my desires ripen into fruits of love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 965 - The day is no more, the shadow is upon the earth. It is time that I go to the scream to fill my pitcher. The evening air is eager with the sad music of the water. Ah, it calls me out into the dusk. In the lonely lane there is no passer-by, the wind is up, the ripples are rampant in the river. I know not if I shall come back home. I know not whom I shall chance to meet. There at the fording in the little boat the unknown man plays upon his lute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 978 - From the words of the poet men take what meanings please them; yet their last meaning points to thee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 988 - And when my work shall be done in this world, O King of kings, alone and speechless</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 988 - And when my work shall be done in this world, O King of kings, alone and speechless shall I stand before thee face to face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 996 - Thou art the Brother amongst my brothers, but I heed them not; I divide not my earnings with them, thus sharing my all with thee. In pleasure and in pain I stand not by the side of men, and thus stand by thee. I shrink to give up my life, and thus do not plunge into the great waters of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1009 - Only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile and whisper among themselves – “Vain is this seeking! Unbroken perfection is over all!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1015 - If it is not my portion to meet thee in this my life then let me ever feel that I have missed thy sight – let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1019 - When I sit by the roadside, tired and panting, when I spread my bed low in the dust, let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me – let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1028 - I am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn uselessly roaming in the sky, O my sun ever-glorious! Thy touch has not yet melted my vapour, making me one with thy light, and thus I count months and years separated from thee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1051 - At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut; but I find that yet there is time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1059 - Wealth and face come from thee and it is for thee to give or to withhold them. But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own, and when I bring it to thee as my offering thou rewardest me with thy grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1068 - It is this overspreading pain that deepens into loves and desires, into sufferings and joys in human homes; and this it is that ever melts and flows in songs through my poet’s heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1085 - The night is dark and my hear is fearful – yet I will take up the lamp, open my gates and bow to him my welcome. It is thy messenger who stands at my door. I will worship him with folded hands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1097 - I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish – no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1111 - Many new images are built by masters of cunning art and carried to the holy stream of oblivion when their time is come. Only the deity of the ruined temple remains un-worshipped in deathless neglect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1128 - On the day when death will knock at thy door what wilt thou offer to him? Oh, I will set before my guest the full vessel of my life – I will never let him go with empty hands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1146 - I know that the day will come when my sight of this earth shall be lost, and life will take its leave in silence, drawing the last curtain over my eyes. Yet stars will watch at night, and morning rise as before, and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasure and pains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1150 - Things that I longed for in vain and things that I got – let them pass. Let me but truly possess the things that I ever spurned and overlooked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1216 - These my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, and trying to light them I forget all else again and again. But I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, spreading my mat on the floor; and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, come silently and take thy seat here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1252 - In one salutation to thee, my God, let all my sense spread out and touch this world at thy feet. Like a rain-cloud of July hung low with its burden of unshed showers let all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1343 - when we came into contact with the Western races with their material superiority over the Eastern Humanity and Eastern culture, and in the educational establishments no provision was made for our own culture. And for over a century our students have been brought up in utter ignorance of the worth of their own civilization of the past. Thus we did not only lose touch of the great which lay hidden in our own inheritance, but also the great honour of being able to contribute to the civilization of Humanity, to have opportunity of giving what we have and not merely begging from others, not merely borrowing culture and living like eternal schoolboys.</p>
