<li>
<p>loc 138 - he became the archetype of the Renaissance Man, an inspiration to all who believe that the “infinite works of nature,” as he put it, are woven together in a unity filled with marvelous patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 142 - His scientific explorations informed his art. He peeled flesh off the faces of cadavers, delineated the muscles that move the lips, and then painted the world’s most memorable smile. He studied human skulls, made layered drawings of the bones and teeth, and conveyed the skeletal agony of Saint Jerome in the Wilderness. He explored the mathematics of optics, showed how light rays strike the cornea, and produced magical illusions of changing visual perspectives in The Last Supper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 147 - This ability to “make a flat surface display a body as if modeled and separated from this plane,” Leonardo said, was “the first intention of the painter.”3 Largely due to his work, dimensionality became the supreme innovation of Renaissance art.

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 183 - Vision without execution is hallucination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 202 - Over and over again, year after year, Leonardo lists things he must do and learn. Some involve the type of close observation most of us rarely pause to do. “Observe the goose’s foot: if it were always open or always closed the creature would not be able to make any kind of movement.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 205 - “Why is the fish in the water swifter than the bird in the air when it ought to be the contrary since the water is heavier and thicker than the air?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 230 - mastering his insights, or mustering a modicum of his talents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 232 - Just as combining the steam engine with ingenious machinery drove the Industrial Revolution, the combination of the computer and distributed networks led to a digital revolution that allowed anyone to create, disseminate, and access any information anywhere.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 259 - distribution of information from gatekeepers, central authorities, and institutions that employed scriveners and scribes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 308 - Shakespeare’s Henry V—the story of a willful and immature prince who becomes a passionate but sensitive, callous but sentimental, inspiring but flawed king—begins with the exhortation “O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend / The brightest heaven of invention.” For Steve Jobs, the ascent to the brightest heaven of invention begins with a tale of two sets of parents, and of growing up in a valley that was just learning how to turn silicon into gold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 313 - Antonio di Piero del Vaccha, he was called Accattabriga, which means “Troublemaker,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 324 - With sarcastic scorn Byron mocked the mill owners of Nottingham, who were pushing a bill that would make destroying automated looms a crime punishable by death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 330 - He became the toast of literary London and was feted at three parties each day, most memorably a lavish morning dance hosted by Lady Caroline Lamb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 335 - “The man who has intercourse aggressively and uneasily will produce children who are irritable and untrustworthy,” he wrote, “but if the intercourse is done with great love and desire on both sides, the child will be of great intellect, witty, lively, and lovable.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 363 - “Mathematical Medea,” threatened to expose his alleged incestuous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 386 - I am fully aware that my not being a man of letters may cause certain presumptuous people to think that they may with reason blame me, alleging that I am a man without learning. Foolish folk! . . . They strut about puffed up and pompous, decked out and adorned not with their own labors, but by those of others. . . . They will say that because I have no book learning I cannot properly express what I desire to describe—but they do not know</p>

They will say that because I have no book learning I cannot properly express what I desire to describe—but they do not know that my subjects require experience rather than the words of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 387 - “The key question about Steve is why he can’t control himself at times from being so reflexively cruel and harmful to some people,” he said. “That goes back to being abandoned at birth. The real underlying problem was the theme of abandonment in Steve’s life.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 411 - “Writing about the kite seems to be my destiny since among the first recollections of my infancy, it seemed to me that, as I was in my cradle, a kite came to me and opened my mouth with its tail and struck me several times with its tail inside my lips.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 413 - and Ada would often visit his Saturday-evening salons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 426 - “I love it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn’t cost much,” he said as he pointed out the clean elegance of the houses. “It was the original vision for Apple. That’s what we tried to do with the</p>

<p>loc 429 - years it had hung over Ada’s grandparents’ mantelpiece,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 431 - Leonardo said so himself. “Intellectual passion drives out sensuality,” he wrote in one of his notebooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 433 - “What is it you don’t understand about the universe?” Jobs replied, “I don’t understand why all of a sudden my dad is so broke.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 446 - “Oh time, swift despoiler of all things, how many kings, how many nations hast thou undone, and how many changes of states and of circumstances have happened since this wondrous fish perished.” By this point</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 450 - “The rivers will be deprived of their waters, the earth will no longer put forth her greenery; the fields will no more be decked with waving corn; all the animals, finding no fresh grass for pasture, will die,” he wrote. “In this way the fertile and fruitful earth will be forced to end with the element of fire; and then its surface will be left burnt up to cinder and this will be the end of all earthly nature.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 465 - Integrated Electronics Corporation,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 513 - “Beautiful Florence has all seven of the fundamental things a city requires for perfection,” the essayist Benedetto Dei wrote in 1472, when Leonardo was living there. “First of all, it enjoys complete liberty; second, it has a large, rich, and elegantly dressed population; third, it has a river with clear, pure water, and mills within its walls; fourth, it rules over castles, towns, lands and people; fifth, it has a university, and both Greek and accounting are taught; sixth, it has masters in every art; seventh, it has banks and business agents all over the world.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 534 - More than a century before Leonardo arrived, the most prosperous merchants and guild leaders crafted a republic whose elected delegates met at the Palazzo della Signoria, now known as the Palazzo Vecchio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 542 - By managing the fortunes of the continent’s wealthy families, the Medici made themselves the wealthiest of them all. They were innovators in bookkeeping, including the use of debit-and-credit accounting that became one of the great spurs to progress during the Renaissance. By means of payoffs and plotting, Cosimo became the de facto ruler of Florence, and his patronage made it the cradle of Renaissance art and humanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 553 - During his twenty-three-year reign, he would sponsor innovative artists, including Botticelli and Michelangelo, as well as patronize the workshops of Andrea del Verrocchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Antonio del Pollaiuolo, which were producing paintings and sculptures to adorn the booming city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 772 - From the eyes of his angel in the Baptism of Christ to the smile of the Mona Lisa, the blurred and smoke-veiled edges allow a role for our own imagination. With no sharp lines, enigmatic glances and smiles can flicker mysteriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 804 - scraggly beard, gave him the aura of a crazed shaman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 901 - His Tobias leans in as he strides, his cloak billowing out behind him while tassels and threads flutter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 946 - Like most artists, Verrocchio drew lines to delineate the contours of his angel’s head and face and eyes. But in Leonardo’s angel, there are no clear edges that delineate the features. The curls dissolve gently into each other and the face, rather than creating a hairline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1203 - “Turn on, boot up, jack in.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1219 - “I see God in the instruments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1219 - “I see God in the instruments and mechanisms that work reliably.”</p>
</li>

<p>loc 1602 - Earth restaurant (Jobs’s). He finally acquiesced,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1832 - As he once said, “Picasso had a saying—‘good artists copy, great artists steal’—and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1836 - Both assessments contain a lot of truth, but there is more to it than that. There falls a shadow, as T. S. Eliot noted, between the conception and the creation.</p>

<p>loc 1836 - Both assessments contain a lot of truth, but there is more to it than that. There falls a shadow, as T. S. Eliot noted, between the conception and the creation. In the annals of innovation, new ideas are only part of the equation. Execution is just as important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1928 - Before and after he was rich, and indeed throughout a life that included being both broke and a billionaire, Steve Jobs’s attitude toward wealth was complex. He was an antimaterialistic hippie who capitalized on the inventions of a friend who wanted to give them away for free, and he was a Zen devotee who made a pilgrimage to India and then decided that his calling was to create a business. And yet somehow these attitudes seemed to weave together rather than conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2161 - It was as if Jobs’s brain circuits were missing a device that would modulate the extreme spikes of impulsive opinions that popped into his mind. So in dealing with him, the Mac team adopted an audio concept called a “low pass filter.” In processing his input, they learned to reduce the amplitude of his high-frequency signals. That served to smooth out the data set and provide a less jittery moving average of his evolving attitudes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2371 - One of the new engineers interrupted and asked why it mattered. “The only thing that’s important is how well it works. Nobody is going to see the PC board.” Jobs reacted typically. “I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it.” In an interview a few years later, after the Macintosh came out, Jobs again reiterated that lesson from his father: “When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2887 - public unveiling of the product itself, amid fanfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2964 - he would cut to the heart of issues with lapidary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2968 - “Each one thought he was smarter than the other one, but Steve generally treated Bill as someone who was slightly inferior, especially in matters of taste and style,” said Andy Hertzfeld. “Bill looked down on Steve because he couldn’t actually program.” From the beginning of their relationship, Gates was fascinated by Jobs and slightly envious of his mesmerizing effect on people. But he also found him “fundamentally odd” and “weirdly flawed as a human being,” and he was put off by Jobs’s rudeness and his tendency to be “either in the mode of saying you were shit or trying to seduce you.” For his part, Jobs found Gates unnervingly narrow. “He’d be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger,” Jobs once declared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3055 - They met in Jobs’s conference room, where Gates found himself surrounded by ten Apple employees who were eager to watch their boss assail him. Jobs didn’t disappoint his troops. “You’re ripping us off!” he shouted. “I trusted you, and now you’re stealing from us!” Hertzfeld recalled that Gates just sat there coolly, looking Steve in the eye, before hurling back, in his squeaky voice, what became a classic zinger. “Well, Steve, I think there’s more than one way of looking at it. I think it’s more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3078 - And yet Jobs’s dismay was understandable. Apple had been more innovative, imaginative, elegant in execution, and brilliant in design. But even though Microsoft created a crudely copied series of products, it would end up winning the war of operating systems. This exposed an aesthetic flaw in how the universe worked: The best and most innovative products don’t always win.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3165 - instant dislike to Apple’s general manager, a soft rotund</p>
</li>
