<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 506 - …That instead of looking for a conversation she’ll enjoy, you could talk about something you enjoy and see if she takes interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 512 - Looking for a person who meets your needs instead of trying to always meet theirs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 521 - The only real dating advice is self-improvement. Work on yourself. Conquer your anxieties. Resolve your shame. Take care of yourself and those who are important to you. Love yourself. Otherwise no, one else will</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 579 - But when a narcissistic man is rejected, he becomes angry and hurt. He blames the woman for not seeing his greatness. He calls her stupid or selfish or shallow because she’s not willing to give him what he – a random guy talking to her – wants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 617 - I always tell men, if every girl you date is unstable and crazy, that’s a reflection of your emotional maturity level. It’s a reflection of your confidence or lack of confidence. It’s a reflection of your neediness. Non-needy people don’t date needy people and vice-versa. They can’t because there’s no attraction to begin with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 627 - Permanent change to one’s investment and neediness in one’s relationships with women is hard and is a process that encompasses all facets of one’s life. But it’s a worthwhile journey. As a man, it may be the most worthwhile journey. And the key to it is probably something you wouldn’t expect. In fact, it’s something that most men turn their nose up at when they hear it. The key is vulnerability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 652 - A man who’s able to make himself vulnerable is saying to the world, “Screw the repercussions; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else.” He’s saying he is non-needy and high status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 784 - But I’ll say this: if you consistently find it difficult to keep a woman interested in conversation; if you suffer from large amounts of anxiety around women; if you constantly feel a need to prove something to others or yourself, then there’s something there. Trust me, there’s something there. And there’s something you’re not expressing or some emotion you’re not in touch with. And that’s fine. We all go through it. Ultimately, what women</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 793 - No. Wrong. It’s not about words or behaviors, it’s about intentions. So if you’re going around telling sob stories and talking about insecurities to get laid, women will sense that and you will be a creep. That is not vulnerability; that is merely another form of performance. And all performance is neediness. Similarly, if you go around saying and doing whatever you want around women in the name of “expressing yourself,” this, too, will not “work” because your intention is not to connect with her and get to know her, but rather simple self-gratification. This is not vulnerability, this is narcissism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 805 - The whole idea of something “working” on women, is itself a form of neediness. Because a sexual connection is not something you achieve. It’s not a level in a video game that you beat. It’s not something you can strategize. It’s either there or it’s not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 816 - So the catch is that everything you say must be as authentic as possible. There’s no shortcut. There are no tricks. You say it because you mean it and mean it because you say it. The more nervous it makes you, the better, because it means you’re being authentic and making yourself vulnerable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 851 - But what I learned is that regardless of what you say to a woman, the intention and implications of why you are saying it are far more powerful than the words themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 861 - Like I described before, this performance-based stuff works sometimes, but it’s a short-term solution that requires a lot of time and effort. In my opinion, it’s a terrible investment of time and effort. You may as well invest that time and effort in yourself and let your identity and honesty do all of the attracting for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 877 - The fact that he honestly expressed to her his intentions, that he put his nuts on the chopping block and made himself vulnerable to her immediately, actually sub-communicates non-neediness and attractiveness in itself. And on top of that, it shows desire for her, which is going to trigger her arousal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 887 - It’s because I was saying it looking for a reaction. Once again, I was highly invested in how women responded to me. I simply did not get it at the time. It didn’t matter what I said or didn’t say; if I said it in a way that demonstrated I cared way too much about how they responded to me, it would never work. I would come off as a creep and women would avoid me as if I had gonorrhea on my face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 896 - You cannot fake non-neediness for more than a moment. The only women you will manage to fake are women who are drunk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 896 - You cannot fake non-neediness for more than a moment. The only women you will manage to fake are women who are drunk or who are extremely needy themselves. Truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 904 - Even if you are exaggerating or putting on a bit of an act to impress a person, your intentions will always shine through, eventually, and they will say more about you than any word ever could.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 945 - An attractive man expresses his interest unconditionally, expecting nothing in return. This arouses women and when they do reciprocate his interest, their interest is, in fact, a gift in return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 950 - I don’t use my compliments as a bargaining tool. I give them unconditionally. A needy man will give a woman a compliment without knowing her and wait expectantly for her to repay him in either her company or with thanks or with sexual favors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 966 - Here’s the litmus test. Look at your actions and words around women and look at the intentions behind them. These intentions are always speaking ten times louder than your actual words. What are they saying?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 982 - But delivering honesty unconditionally isn’t just about compliments and appreciation. Unconditional honesty can be brutal and scathing at times as well. And strangely enough, brutal and angry honesty can turn a woman on just as much as the most genuine compliment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1010 - My answer to these men is always the same: if you make it clear from the beginning that you are unwilling to put up with games, then not only will the women you attract stop playing games, but you’ll stop attracting women who do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1012 - In the example above, my plan of action? I would have said to her, “Let me know when you’d like to get together again. If you’re not interested, that’s fine too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1012 - In the example above, my plan of action? I would have said to her, “Let me know when you’d like to get together again. If you’re not interested, that’s fine too.” Yes, I will actually say this to her. Not in a harsh manner. But in a clear manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1022 - Men who are non-needy establish strict boundaries because they value their own time and happiness more than receiving attention from a woman. They also see no reason to trample over other people’s boundaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1026 - The problem with forming strong boundaries is that in order to form them, you have to be particularly aware of your own desires and emotions. And many men who have been needy their entire lives are not very self-aware. They don’t know what they’re willing to stand up for and what they’re willing to let slide. They don’t know their own emotional motivations and desires.</p>
