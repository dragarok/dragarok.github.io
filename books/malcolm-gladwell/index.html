<p>loc 1379 - Lareau calls the middle-class parenting style “concerted cultivation.” It’s an attempt to actively “foster and assess a child’s talents, opinions and skills.” Poor parents tend to follow, by contrast, a strategy of “accomplishment of natural growth.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1379 - Lareau calls the middle-class parenting style “concerted cultivation.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1399 - Alex’s mother, Lareau writes, “is teaching that he has the right to speak up”—that even though he’s going to be in a room with an older person and authority figure, it’s perfectly all right for him to assert himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1422 - Alex Williams didn’t inherit the skills to interact with authority figures from his parents and grandparents the way he inherited the color of his eyes. Nor is it racial: it’s not a practice specific to either black or white people. As it turns out, Alex Williams is black and Katie Brindle is white. It’s a cultural advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1428 - Alex Williams is better off than Katie Brindle because he’s wealthier and because he goes to a better school, but also because—and perhaps this is even more critical—the sense of entitlement that he has been taught is an attitude perfectly suited to succeeding in the modern world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1524 - “I wanted to get into the law since I was six years old,” Flom says. He didn’t have a degree from college. Harvard took him anyway. “Why? I wrote them a letter on why I was the answer to sliced bread,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1530 - During “hiring season,” the Christmas break of his second year, he went down to New York to interview with the big corporate law firms of the day. “I was ungainly, awkward, a fat kid. I didn’t feel comfortable,” Flom remembers. “I was one of two kids in my class at the end of hiring season who didn’t have a job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1542 - Today Skadden, Arps has nearly two thousand attorneys in twenty-three offices around the world and earns well over $1 billion a year, making it one of the largest and most powerful law firms in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1558 - We tell rags-to-riches stories because we find something captivating in the idea of a lone hero battling overwhelming odds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1559 - But the true story of Joe Flom’s life turns out to be much more intriguing than the mythological version because all the things in his life that seem to have been disadvantages—that he was a poor child of garment workers; that he was Jewish at a time when Jews were heavily discriminated against; that he grew up in the Depression—turn out, unexpectedly, to have been advantages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1582 - Mudge Rose saying no to Bickel because of his “antecedents” was like the Chicago Bulls turning down Michael Jordan because they were uncomfortable with black kids from North Carolina.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1611 - What the old-line firms also did not do was involve themselves in hostile corporate takeovers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1618 - The work that “came in the door” to the generation of Jewish lawyers from the Bronx and Brooklyn in the 1950s and 1960s, then, was the work the white-shoe firms disdained: litigation and, more important, “proxy fights,” which were the legal maneuvers at the center of any hostile-takeover bid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1624 - The winner of a proxy contest was determined in the snake pit. (Officially, it was called the counting room.) Lawyers for each side met with inspectors of elections, whose job it was to approve or eliminate questionable proxies. The event was often informal, contentious and unruly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1644 - Companies needed to be defended against lawsuits from rivals. Hostile suitors needed to be beaten back. Investors who wanted to devour unwilling targets needed help with their legal strategy, and shareholders needed formal representation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1652 - Think of how similar this is to the stories of Bill Joy and Bill Gates. Both of them toiled away in a relatively obscure field without any great hopes for worldly success. But then—boom!—the personal computer revolution happened, and they had their ten thousand hours in. They were ready. Flom had the same experience. For twenty years he perfected his craft at Skadden, Arps. Then the world changed and he was ready. He didn’t triumph over adversity. Instead, what started out as adversity ended up being an opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1691 - This same demographic logic applies to Jewish lawyers in New York like Maurice Janklow. The doors were closed to them at the big downtown law firms. So they were overwhelmingly solo practitioners, handling wills and divorces and contracts and minor disputes, and in the Depression the work of the solo practitioner all but disappeared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1697 - Maurice Janklow was born in 1902. When the Depression started, he was newly married and had just bought his big car, moved to Queens, and made his great gamble on the writing-paper business. His timing could not have been worse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1849 - More people worked making clothes in New York than at anything else, and more clothes were manufactured in New York than in any other city in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1853 - To come to New York City in the 1890s with a background in dressmaking or sewing or Schnittwaren Handlung was a stroke of extraordinary good fortune.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1855 - “There is no doubt that those Jewish immigrants arrived at the perfect time, with the perfect skills,” says the sociologist Stephen Steinberg. “To exploit that opportunity, you had to have certain virtues, and those immigrants worked hard. They sacrificed. They scrimped and saved and invested wisely. But still, you have to remember that the garment industry in those years was growing by leaps and bounds. The economy was desperate for the skills that they possessed.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1884 - From my study of the market I knew that only three men were making children’s dresses in 1890. One was an East Side tailor near me, who made only to order, while the other two turned out an expensive product with which I had no desire at all to compete. I wanted to make “popular price” stuff—wash dresses, silks, and woolens. It was my goal to produce dresses that the great mass of the people could afford, dresses that would—from the business angle—sell equally well to both large and small, city and country stores. With Regina’s help—she always had excellent taste, and judgment—I made up a line of samples. Displaying them to all my “old” customers and friends, I hammered home every point—my dresses would save mothers endless work, the materials and sewing were as good and probably better than anything that could be done at home, the price was right for quick disposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1896 - What Borgenicht was getting in his eighteen-hour days was a lesson in the modern economy. He was learning market research. He was learning manufacturing. He was learning how to negotiate with imperious Yankees. He was learning how to plug himself into popular culture in order to understand new fashion trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1910 - Those three things—autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward—are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1922 - Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning. Once it does, it becomes the kind of thing that makes you grab your wife around the waist and dance a jig.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2071 - “The critical moment in the development of the young shepherd’s reputation is his first quarrel,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2080 - They were herdsmen, scraping out a living on rocky and infertile land. They were clannish, responding to the harshness and turmoil of their environment by forming tight family bonds and placing loyalty to blood above all else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2083 - “To the first settlers, the American backcountry was a dangerous environment, just as the British borderlands had been,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2109 - The “culture of honor” hypothesis says that it matters where you’re from, not just in terms of where you grew up or where your parents grew up, but in terms of where your great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents grew up and even where your great-great-great-grandparents grew up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2136 - The deciding factor in how they reacted wasn’t how emotionally secure they were, or whether they were intellectuals or jocks, or whether they were physically imposing or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2140 - But the southerners? Oh, my. They were angry. Their cortisol and testosterone jumped. Their handshakes got firm. Steve was all over Larry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2234 - Korean Air did not succeed—it did not right itself—until it acknowledged the importance of its cultural legacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2241 - In 52 percent of crashes, the pilot at the time of the accident has been awake for twelve hours or more, meaning that he is tired and not thinking sharply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2241 - In 52 percent of crashes, the pilot at the time of the accident has been awake for twelve hours or more, meaning that he is tired and not thinking sharply. And 44 percent of the time, the two pilots have never flown together before, so they’re not comfortable with each other. Then the errors start—and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2248 - One pilot knows something important and somehow doesn’t tell the other pilot. One pilot does something wrong, and the other pilot doesn’t catch the error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2286 - That’s what happens when you’re tired. Your decision-making skills erode. You start missing things—things that you would pick up on any other day.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2301 - But did the pilots raise the issue again, looking for clarification? No. Nor did they bring up the issue of fuel again for another thirty-eight minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2326 - Think about what was required of Ratwatte. He had to be a good pilot. That much goes without saying: he had to have the technical skill to land heavy. But almost everything else Ratwatte did that made that emergency landing a success fell outside the strict definition of piloting skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2358 - According to another of the controllers who handled 052 that night, Klotz spoke “in a very nonchalant manner…. There was no urgency in the voice.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2360 - Klotz was engaging in in that moment is “mitigated speech,” which refers to any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said. We mitigate when we’re being polite, or when we’re ashamed or embarrassed, or when we’re being deferential to authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2399 - Planes are safer when the least experienced pilot is flying, because it means the second pilot isn’t going to be afraid to speak up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2406 - “On a very simple level, one of the things we insist upon at my airline is that the first officer and the captain call each other by their first names,” Ratwatte said. “We think that helps. It’s just harder to say, ‘Captain, you’re doing something wrong,’ than to use a name.” Ratwatte</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2424 - There it is again. No mention of the magic word “emergency,” which is what air traffic controllers are trained to listen for. Just “running out of fuel, sir” at the end of a sentence, preceded by the mitigating “ah.” If you’re counting errors, the Avianca crew is now in double digits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2442 - Anyway, a female controller got mad at him, and said, ‘Stop. Don’t do anything. Do not talk to me until I talk to you.’ And she just left him there. Finally the pilot picks up the microphone and says, ‘Madam. Was I married to you in a former life?’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2459 - What if there was something about the pilots’ being Colombian that led to that crash? “Look, no American pilot would put up with that. That’s the thing,” Ratwatte said. “They would say, ‘Listen, buddy. I have to land.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2465 - Today “Hofstede’s Dimensions” are among the most widely used paradigms in crosscultural psychology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2482 - Each of us has his or her own distinct personality. But overlaid on top of that are tendencies and assumptions and reflexes handed down to us by the history of the community we grew up in, and those differences are extraordinarily specific.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2491 - Power distance is concerned with attitudes toward hierarchy, specifically with how much a particular culture values and respects authority. To</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2496 - power is something of which power holders are almost ashamed and they will try to underplay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2502 - What was their great battle over mitigated speech and teamwork all about, after all? It was an attempt to reduce power distance in the cockpit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2505 - And Hofstede’s work suggested something that had not occurred to anyone in the aviation world: that the task of convincing first officers to assert themselves was going to depend an awful lot on their culture’s power distance rating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2516 - Klotz sees himself as a subordinate. It’s not his job to solve the crisis. It’s the captain’s—and the captain is exhausted and isn’t saying anything. Then there’s the domineering Kennedy Airport air traffic controllers ordering the planes around. Klotz is trying to tell them he’s in trouble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2516 - Klotz sees himself as a subordinate. It’s not his job to solve the crisis. It’s the captain’s—and the captain is exhausted and isn’t saying anything. Then there’s the domineering Kennedy Airport air traffic controllers ordering the planes around. Klotz is trying to tell them he’s in trouble. But he’s using his own cultural language, speaking as a subordinate would to a superior. The controllers, though, aren’t Colombian. They’re low–power distance New Yorkers. They don’t see any hierarchical gap between themselves and the pilots in the air, and to them, mitigated speech from a pilot doesn’t mean the speaker is being appropriately deferential to a superior. It means the pilot doesn’t have a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2526 - Angry! Klotz’s feelings are hurt! His plane is moments from disaster. But he cannot escape the dynamic dictated to him by his culture in which subordinates must respect the dictates of their superiors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2533 - The copilot was right. But they died because… when the copilot asked questions, his implied suggestions were very weak. The captain’s reply was to ignore him totally. Perhaps the copilot did not want to appear rebellious, questioning the judgment of the captain, or he did not want to play the fool because he knew that the pilot had a great deal of experience flying in that area. The copilot should have advocated for his own opinions in a stronger way…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2603 - At a dinner table, a lower-ranking person must wait until a higher-ranking person sits down and starts eating, while the reverse does not hold true; one does not smoke in the presence of a social superior;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2608 - So, when the first officer says, “Don’t you think it rains more? In this area, here?” we know what he means by that: Captain. You have committed us to visual approach, with no backup plan, and the weather outside is terrible. You think that we will break out of the clouds in time to see the runway. But what if we don’t? It’s pitch-black outside and pouring rain and the glide scope is down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2617 - The weather radar has helped us a lot? A second hint from the flight deck. What the engineer means is just what the first officer meant. This isn’t a night where you can rely on just your eyes to land the plane. Look at what the weather radar is telling us: there’s trouble ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2620 - Western communication has what linguists call a “transmitter orientation”—that is, it is considered the responsibility of the speaker to communicate ideas clearly and unambiguously. Even in the tragic case of the Air Florida crash, where the first officer never does more than hint about the danger posed by the ice, he still hints four times, phrasing his comments four different ways, in an attempt to make his meaning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2628 - KWACHANG: It’s cold and I’m kind of hungry. [MEANING: Why don’t you buy a drink or something to eat?] MR. KIM: How about having a glass of liquor? [MEANING: I will buy liquor for you.] KWACHANG: It’s okay. Don’t bother. [MEANING: I will accept your offer if you repeat it.] MR. KIM: You must be hungry. How about going out? [MEANING: I insist upon treating you.] KWACHANG: Shall I do so? [MEANING: I accept.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2638 - high–power distance communication works only when the listener is capable of paying close attention, and it works only if the two parties in a conversation have the luxury of time, in order to unwind each other’s meanings. It doesn’t work in an airplane cockpit on a stormy night with an exhausted pilot trying to land at an airport with a broken glide scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2678 - Why are we so squeamish? Why is the fact that each of us comes from a culture with its own distinctive mix of strengths and weaknesses, tendencies and predispositions, so difficult to acknowledge? Who we are cannot be separated from where we’re from—and when we ignore that fact, planes crash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2757 - Chinese number words are remarkably brief. Most of them can be uttered in less than one-quarter of a second (for instance, 4 is “si” and 7 “qi”). Their English equivalents—“four,” “seven”—are longer: pronouncing them takes about one-third of a second. The memory gap between English and Chinese apparently is entirely due to this difference in length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2761 - Cantonese dialect of Chinese, whose brevity grants residents of Hong Kong a rocketing memory span of about 10 digits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2768 - The number system in English is highly irregular. Not so in China, Japan, and Korea. They have a logical counting system. Eleven is ten-one. Twelve is ten-two. Twenty-four is two-tens-four and so on. That difference means that Asian children learn to count much faster than American children. Four-year-old Chinese children can count, on average, to forty. American children at that age can count only to fifteen, and most don’t reach forty until they’re five.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2793 - But the differences between the number systems in the East and the West suggest something very different—that being good at math may also be rooted in a group’s culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2808 - rice farmers improved their yields by becoming smarter, by being better managers of their own time, and by making better choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2845 - It was meaningful. First of all, there is a clear relationship in rice farming between effort and reward. The harder you work a rice field, the more it yields. Second, it’s complex work. The rice farmer isn’t simply planting in the spring and harvesting in the fall. He or she effectively runs a small business, juggling a family workforce, hedging uncertainty through seed selection, building and managing a sophisticated irrigation system, and coordinating the complicated process of harvesting the first crop while simultaneously preparing the second crop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2851 - Growing rice is too complicated and intricate for a system that requires farmers to be coerced and bullied into going out into the fields each morning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2860 - That’s why you get fixed rents, where the landlord says, I get twenty bushels, regardless of the harvest, and if it’s really good, you get the extra. It’s</p>

<p>loc 2943 - “Look,” he said. “She does a double take. Many students would just let that fly by. Instead, she thought, ‘That doesn’t jibe with whatever I’m thinking. I don’t get it. That’s important. I want an explanation.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2954 - imagine a country where Renee’s doggedness is not the exception, but a cultural trait, embedded as deeply as the culture of honor in the Cumberland Plateau. Now that would be a country good at math.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2966 - countries whose students are willing to concentrate and sit still long enough and focus on answering every single question in an endless questionnaire are the same countries whose students do the best job of solving math problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2976 - So, which places are at the top of both lists? The answer shouldn’t surprise you: Singapore, South Korea, China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, and Japan. What those five have in common, of course, is that they are all cultures shaped by the tradition of wet-rice agriculture and meaningful work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2999 - What KIPP is most famous for is mathematics. In the South Bronx, only about 16 percent of all middle school students are performing at or above their grade level in math. But at KIPP, by the end of fifth grade, many of the students call math their favorite subject. In seventh grade, KIPP students start high school algebra. By the end of eighth grade, 84 percent of the students are performing at or above their grade level,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3008 - KIPP is, rather, an organization that has succeeded by taking the idea of cultural legacies seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3016 - In 1871, for example, the US commissioner of education published a report by Edward Jarvis on the “Relation of Education to Insanity.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3023 - strove for ways to reduce time spent studying, because long periods of respite could save the mind from injury. Hence the elimination of Saturday classes, the shortening of the school day, and the lengthening of vacation—all of which occurred over the course of the nineteenth century.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3039 - Summer vacation is a topic seldom mentioned in American educational debates. It is considered a permanent and inviolate feature of school life, like high school football or the senior prom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3058 - Look at the first column. The students start in first grade with meaningful, but not overwhelming, differences in their knowledge and ability. The first graders from the wealthiest homes have a 32-point advantage over the first graders from the poorest homes—and by the way, first graders from poor homes in Baltimore are really</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3061 - This “achievement gap” is a phenomenon that has been observed over and over again, and it typically provokes one of two responses. The first response is that disadvantaged kids simply don’t have the same inherent ability to learn as children from more privileged backgrounds. They’re not as smart. The second, slightly more optimistic conclusion is that, in some way, our schools are failing poor children: we simply aren’t doing a good enough job of teaching them the skills they need. But here’s where Alexander’s study gets interesting, because it turns out that neither of those explanations rings true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3065 - The city of Baltimore didn’t give its kids the California Achievement Test just at the end of every school year, in June. It gave them the test in September too, just after summer vacation ended. What Alexander realized is that the second set of test results allowed him to do a slightly different analysis. If he looked at the difference between the score a student got at the beginning of the school year, in September, and the score he or she got the following June, he could measure—precisely—how much that student learned over the school year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3107 - The wealthiest kids come back in September and their reading scores have jumped more than 15 points. The poorest kids come back from the holidays and their reading scores have dropped almost 4 points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3111 - When it comes to reading skills, poor kids learn nothing when school is not in session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3122 - Alex isn’t necessarily smarter than Katie. He’s just out-learning her: he’s putting in a few solid months of learning during the summer while she watches television and plays outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3130 - Suddenly the causes of Asian math superiority become even more obvious. Students in Asian schools don’t have long summer vacations. Why would they? Cultures that believe that the route to success lies in rising before dawn 360 days a year are scarcely going to give their children three straight months off in the summer. The school year in the United States is, on average, 180 days long. The South Korean school year is 220 days long. The Japanese school year is 243 days long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3139 - “They start school at seven twenty-five,” says David Levin of the students at the Bronx KIPP Academy. “They all do a course called thinking skills until seven fifty-five. They do ninety minutes of English, ninety minutes of math every day, except in fifth grade, where they do two hours of math a day. An hour of science, an hour of social science, an hour of music at least twice a week, and then you have an hour and fifteen minutes of orchestra on top of that. Everyone does orchestra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3147 - He continued: “Saturdays they come in nine to one. In the summer, it’s eight to two.” By summer, Levin was referring to the fact that KIPP students do three extra weeks of school, in July. These are, after all, precisely the kind of lower-income kids who Alexander identified as losing ground over the long summer vacation, so KIPP’s response is simply to not have a long summer vacation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3159 - “What that extra time does is allow for a more relaxed atmosphere,” Corcoran said, after the class was over. “I find that the problem with math education is the sink-or-swim approach. Everything is rapid fire, and the kids who get it first are the ones who are rewarded. So there comes to be a feeling that there are people who can do math and there are people who aren’t math people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3165 - The extra time gave Corcoran the chance to make mathematics meaningful: to let his students see the clear relationship between effort and reward. On the walls of the classroom were</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3181 - A 5:45 wakeup is fairly typical of KIPP students, especially given the long bus and subway commutes that many have to get to school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3223 - Outliers are those who have been given opportunities—and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3229 - The lesson here is very simple. But it is striking how often it is overlooked. We are so caught in the myths of the best and the brightest and the self-made that we think outliers spring naturally from the earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3233 - To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success—the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history—with a society that provides opportunities for all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3264 - That is the story of my mother’s path to success—and it isn’t true. It’s not a lie in the sense that the facts were made up. But it is false in the way that telling the story of Bill Gates without mentioning the computer at Lakeside is false, or accounting for Asian math prowess without going back to the rice paddies is false. It leaves out my mother’s many opportunities and the importance of her cultural legacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3278 - A year after MacMillan published his book, a wave of riots and unrest swept the Caribbean. Fourteen people were killed and fifty-nine injured in Trinidad. Fourteen were killed and forty-seven injured in Barbados. In Jamaica, a series of violent strikes shut down the country, and a state of emergency was declared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3281 - proposed a series of “all-island” scholarships for academically minded students to go to private high schools. The scholarships began in 1941. My mother and her twin sister sat for the exam the following year. That is how they got a high school education; had they been born two or three or four years earlier, they might never have gotten a full education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3286 - My grandfather may have been an imposing and learned man, but he was an idealist and a dreamer. He buried himself in his books. If he had ambitions for his daughters, he did not have the foresight and energy to make them real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3290 - “If you’d asked her about her goals for her children, she would have said she wanted us out of there,” my mother recalls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3294 - “We have no more money.” They had paid the tuition for the first term and bought the uniforms and had exhausted their savings. What would they do when the second-term fees for my mother came due?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3296 - My grandmother was steadfast. She sent both—and prayed—and at the end of the first term, it turned out that one of the other girls at the school had won two scholarships, so the second was given to my mother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3300 - there was a total of one Centenary scholarship awarded every year for the whole island, with the prize going to the top girl and the top boy in alternating years. The year my aunt applied was one of the “girl” years. She was lucky. My mother was not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3312 - “Did she tell me what she was doing? I didn’t even ask her,” my mother remembers. “It just occurred. I just applied to university and got in. I acted completely on faith that I could rely on my mother, without even realizing that I was relying on my mother.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3328 - And whites saw mulattoes—the children of those relationships—as potential allies, a buffer between them and the enormous numbers of slaves on the island. Mulatto women were prized as mistresses, and their children, one shade lighter in turn, moved still further up the social and economic ladder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3379 - Daisy Ford’s ambition for her daughters did not come from nowhere, in other words. She was the inheritor of a legacy of privilege. Her older brother Rufus, with whom she went to live as a child, was a teacher and a man of learning.</p>
