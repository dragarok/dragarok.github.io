<li>
<p>loc 173 - eventually get married. Being at the right place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 206 - Pretty much everything we do to make ourselves lucky or unlucky can be traced back to attitude and approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 221 - On the other hand, the lucky group approached the task with less anxiety, greater optimism and in a far more relaxed frame of mind. They did not see the need to compete, and this relaxed attitude allowed them to observe beyond the immediate task at hand. This enabled them to spot the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 224 - ‘Those who are doggedly attached to the idea they began with may well execute on that idea. And do it well and fast. But along the way, they often miss so many unanticipated possibilities, options, alternatives, and paths that would’ve taken them away from that linear focus on executing on the vision, and sent them back into a place of creative dissidence and uncertainty, but also very likely yielded something orders of magnitude better.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 252 - Approach is about action, the way that we do things, (as contrasted with attitude, which is more about how we think or feel about someone, something or a situation). Now that we have understood the difference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 285 - ‘Luck hates loneliness. It’s almost impossible to be lucky alone,’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 311 - ‘I guess I had some kind of talent. But if it hadn’t been for this Lauren Bacall fluke, where would the talent have gone? Dozens of my friends back then had talent too, but you don’t see their names in movies today…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 311 - guess I had some kind of talent. But if it hadn’t been for this Lauren Bacall fluke, where would the talent have gone? Dozens of my friends back then had talent too, but you don’t see their names in movies today… Your own luck depends on other people’s luck. It’s crazy!’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 391 - Growing new networks is mostly about leveraging interactions. If you are seated next to a stranger on a flight, do you introduce yourself and try to strike a conversation? If you are invited to a friend’s place for dinner, do you hang out with people you already know or do you attempt to meet new people? Chance encounters are often the routes through which opportunities manifest themselves. The following story illustrates my point:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 419 - ‘The bigger your web of friendly contacts, the better the odds in your favour. You cannot know what thunderbolt of good fortune is being prepared for you now by some distant engine of fate. You cannot know what complex interconnection of human relationships will guide the thunderbolt in your direction. But you can know, with certainty, that the probability of your getting hit is directly proportional to the number of people who know your name.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 491 - A young musician asked Mozart, ‘Herr Mozart, it has been suggested to me that I write a symphony. Would you be good enough to tell me how to go about it?’ Mozart thought for a moment and gently suggested, ‘You are still too young to write symphonies. Why not try ballads first?’ ‘You wrote symphonies when you were ten years old,’ argued the young man indignantly. ‘Ah, yes, but I didn’t ask how,’ replied Mozart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 502 - One of the greatest scientific minds, Albert Einstein, said, ‘The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and has forgotten the gift.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 514 - ‘I’d rather regret the things that I have done than the things that I’ve not done.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 565 - ‘Lucky people are open to novel opportunities and are willing to try things outside of their usual experiences. They’re more inclined to pick up a book on an unfamiliar subject, to travel to less familiar destinations, and to interact with people who are different than themselves.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 578 - ‘Money can’t buy happiness, but neither can poverty.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 608 - A simple act of changing the race we are running often produces dramatically better results, but this requires openness to try new things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 618 - Max Gunther says, ‘The luckiest people I know haven’t lived their lives in a straight line but in a zigzag. It’s a mistake to get stuck on one track. You’ve got to be ready to jump off in a new direction when you see something good.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 626 - Lucky people take calculated risks, cut losses, and learn from mistakes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 695 - Godin tells us that winners quit fast, quit often, and quit without guilt—until they commit themselves to beating the right dip for the right reasons. Once they realize that they are dealing with a dip, not a cul-de-sac, they persevere like crazy to beat it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 704 - Mad Hatter: We only go around in circles in Wonderland, but we always end up where we started. Would you mind explaining yourself? Alice: Well, grown-ups tell us to find out what we did wrong, and never do it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 734 - Lucky people stay positive, persevere and cultivate a thick skin Raise ✓ Attitude ✓ Recognize Approach Respond ✓ The Secret by Rhonda Byrne emphasizes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 734 - Lucky people stay positive, persevere and cultivate a thick skin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 794 - Washington still wanted to complete the project and an idea struck him as he lay in hospital. All he could move was one finger, so he touched his wife’s arm with that single finger, tapping out code to communicate with her. He would continue tapping for the next thirteen years until the bridge that could never be built was built! That’s the power of persistence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 864 - ‘Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail.’ He also said, ‘A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is braver five minutes longer.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 888 - Lucky people find ways to remain calm and thus alert</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 914 - According to proponents of Vipassana, the human mind is like a wild elephant; mindfulness is the rope; and meditation is the fixed post. Meditation and mindfulness can tame the mind, much like the post and rope can tame the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 966 - According to Sachin, that particular slap was a life-changing moment for him. It was the day that he began to take his training very seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 983 - Probably Bessemer is able to talk about these missed opportunities with dignity because, on an average, they have scored more hits than misses. And that’s precisely what one needs to work towards for generating good luck—garnering more hits than misses over the long</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1014 - Lucky people make the best of bad situations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1085 - Beethoven composed his best-known masterpieces after he became deaf. Sir Walter Raleigh wrote History of the World during his thirteen years in prison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1093 - With a sentence of death hanging over him, Dante wrote the Divine Comedy during twenty years of exile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1095 - Oscar Wilde famously quipped, ‘We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1105 - ‘Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1109 - Avul Pakir specialized in aeronautical engineering and it was his dream to become a fighter pilot. He received two interview calls. He ranked ninth (among twenty-five final candidates) in his interview with the Indian Air Force in Dehradun, but was not selected as there were only eight vacancies. Hence he was forced to join the second organization: the Directorate of Technical Development and Production (DTDP) at the Defence Ministry in Delhi. Who was this candidate? Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, more commonly known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1163 - Lucky people develop their confidence and communicate Raise ✓ Attitude ✓ Recognize Approach ✓ Respond ✓ Awkward and shy during my teenage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1163 - Lucky people develop their confidence and communicate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1197 - There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1203 - The Monte Carlo Fallacy (or Gambler’s Fallacy) is the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during some period, then it will happen less frequently in the future, presumably as a means of balancing nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1206 - The problem with the Monte Carlo Fallacy is that someone who has had a spate of good luck automatically tends to believe that his next venture will be unlucky or vice-versa. In effect, the Monte Carlo Fallacy reinforces irrational behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1230 - ‘Words, of course, are the most powerful drug used by humanity,’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1246 - ‘I think a lot of fear comes down to three things: fear of failure, fear of success and fear of change, which is especially important. Everyone hates change they can’t control. They want other people to change, but from a safe distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1256 - Confident, relaxed persons who were not too worried about the outcome were able to observe the large ad on the second page, whereas those who were anxious and fearful ended up remaining tightly focused on the immediate task and thus missed the magic solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1258 - ‘Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it!’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1277 - Communicate more. Communicate better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1324 - The new message read: ‘It’s a beautiful day. You can see it. I cannot.’ What does this story tell us? Simply that there were enough moneyed people passing by—opportunities. A simple change in communication strategy had found a way of harnessing those opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1329 - Lucky people stay informed and absorb new ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1428 - Lucky people understand the power of goodness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1511 - ‘Before telling me anything more, I’d like you to pass a little test. It’s called the Triple Filter Test.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1514 - The first filter is Truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1516 - Let’s try the second filter, the filter of Goodness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1519 - there is a third filter: the filter of Usefulness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1521 - what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1536 - Being nice also tends to be a wise investment. For example, Abraham Lincoln selflessly withdrew from a Senate race in the 1830s, but ended up winning the endorsement of his rival in the next election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1568 - ‘Probably no human frailty is more likely to bring bad luck than an exaggerated need for appreciation. This unhappy state of mind, which usually grows out of a rooted feeling of insecurity, drives its victim to advertise his importance and demand that the busy world pay attention to him. Inevitably, he cuts off favourable chances, which might otherwise emanate from others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1571 - Because the egoist tends to be inattentive when others are talking, he causes acquaintances to take a passive attitude in conversation and to withhold information and ideas that might have had luck value for him.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1601 - ‘A bit of fragrance always clings to the hand that gives roses.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1611 - ‘Always give without remembering and always receive without forgetting.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1615 - Lucky people seek ways to get paid for their passion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1689 - Later, after recovering, when the young man asked Socrates why he had nearly drowned him, Socrates replied, ‘What was it that you most wanted when you were under water?’ ‘Air,’ the young man replied. Socrates responded, ‘When your desire for wisdom is as great as your desire to breathe, you will find wisdom.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1706 - Lucky people unlearn old attitudes and approaches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1728 - ‘The cup has a limited capacity,’ said Nan-in. ‘You are like the cup. You are full of opinions, beliefs, prejudices and attitudes. How can I possibly show you Zen unless you are willing to empty your cup?’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1730 - The point being made was this: one needs to be willing to unlearn in order to learn. One needs to unclutter in order to be capable of receiving from the cosmic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1768 - Satellite Television of the Asian Region (more commonly known as STAR).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1790 - Gautam Mukunda, a professor at the Harvard Business School, studied several political, business, and military leaders, and classified them in two groups: filtered leaders, insiders whose careers followed the usual progression of their sector; and unfiltered leaders, who were either outsiders with virtually no experience of the sector or had got their jobs through odd chance. Do you know who the most effective leaders were? You guessed right. The unfiltered lot!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1806 - Lucky people leverage preparation, planning and potential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1814 - ‘Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1824 - is often joked that the world is a stage and most of us are desperately unrehearsed. Imagine how the odds of your success could improve if you were rehearsed? Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of America, said, ‘By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.’ In a similar vein, Louis Pasteur said, ‘Chance favours the prepared mind.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1837 - That is why people say, ‘In times of danger, when the net is cast, plan ahead or plan to think fast!’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1888 - Another trait of lucky people is that they leverage not only their preparation and planning but also their potential—their strengths. They identify opportunities by ‘connecting the dots’. The following examples illustrate how lucky people leverage their intrinsic potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1919 - Lucky people leverage preparation, planning, prioritization and potential. By doing so, they increase their ability to create opportunities or react and respond to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1973 - Emotional Quotient is a measure of one’s ability to sense, understand and effectively apply the power and acumen of emotions to facilitate high levels of collaboration and productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1975 - The five key drivers of EQ are self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2010 - ‘Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2033 - Lucky people are those who are able to see how lucky they are.</p>
