<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 266 - Kafka’s fiction, though concrete in its particulars, suggests an array of interpretive possibilities. “The Metamorphosis” alone has inspired Catholics to argue a case of transubstantiation, Freudians to extrapolate Gregor’s castration by his father, and Marxists to infer the alienation of man in modern society. Kafka’s descriptions vacillate between realism and allegory—a narrative style best described as parabolic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 288 - We lose in parable the moment we pin things down to an accessible meaning. Realizing it is impossible to discuss or interpret Kafka without losing in parable is the first and perhaps only step we can take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 290 - Kafka’s parables not only fall apart once we interpret them, they are impossible to put into practice. If anything, his parables guarantee the failure not only of his characters, but of readers wishing to abstract any lessons applicable to their own lives. Failure, it seems, is Kafka’s true subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 292 - To get at this conundrum, we must explore discretely the dichotomies Kafka himself con flates—dreams versus reality, idleness versus work, vermin versus human, child versus adult. For Kafka, each of these antagonistic pairs represents an authorial relationship. It is possible to lump the lowly—dreams, idleness, vermin, child—on one side, and the authority figures—reality, work, human, adult—on the other. But ultimately this equation is too simple, for Kafka himself fails to pick a side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 298 - Kafka’s nightmares are so natural, so convincing, that they creep into the reader’s mind almost subliminally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 582 - What if I went back to sleep for a while and forgot all this foolishness,” he thought. However, this was totally impracticable, as he habitually slept on his right side, a position he could not get into in his present state; no matter how forcefully he heaved himself to the right, he rocked onto his back again. He</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 599 - was half past six and the hands were steadily advancing, actually past the half hour and already closer to three quarters past. Did the alarm not ring?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 714 - shocked, then Gregor was no longer responsible and could be calm. But if they accepted everything calmly, then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 735 - unlock it by taking the key into his mouth. Unfortunately he appeared to have no teeth—how then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 781 - persuaded, and ultimately won over; the very future of Gregor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 845 - That morning, when the doors had been locked, they all wanted to come in; now after he had opened the one door and the others had been opened during the day, no one came and the keys were now on the other side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 914 - were displeased to hear even these innocent allusions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1061 - hair was combed flat, exactingly parted and gleaming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1066 - And so he ran from the father, stopping only when the father stood still, and scurried away again as soon as the father moved. In this way they circled the room several times without anything decisive happening; in fact they proceeded so slowly it did not look like a chase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1211 - Was he a beast if music could move him so? He felt as though the path to his unknown hungers was being cleared. He was grimly determined to reach the sister and tug on her skirt to suggest that she take her violin and come into his room, for no one here was as worthy of her playing as he would be</p>
