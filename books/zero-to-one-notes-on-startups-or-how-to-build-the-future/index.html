<li>
<p>loc 123 - in business, small groups of people bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better. The easiest explanation for this is negative: it’s hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it’s even harder to do it by yourself. Bureaucratic hierarchies move slowly, and entrenched interests shy away from risk. In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if this describes your company, you should quit now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 127 - Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 136 - “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Nietzsche wrote (before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 144 - The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 224 - Make incremental advances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 226 - Stay lean and flexible All companies must be “lean,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 226 - Stay lean and flexible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 227 - You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead you should try things out, “iterate,” and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 229 - Improve on the competition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 232 - Focus on product, not sales</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 236 - And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct: 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2. A bad plan is better than no plan. 3. Competitive markets destroy profits. 4. Sales matters just as much as product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 240 - Too few startups were actually getting there, and many never went beyond talking about it. But people understood that we had no choice but to find ways to do more with less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 245 - To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon the dogmas created after the crash. That doesn’t mean the opposite ideas are automatically true: you can’t escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 247 - The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 249 - THE BUSINESS VERSION of our contrarian question is: what valuable company is nobody building?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 249 - THE BUSINESS VERSION of our contrarian question is: what valuable company is nobody building? This question is harder than it looks, because your company could create a lot of value without becoming very valuable itself. Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 257 - Google stands alone. Economists use two simplified models to explain the difference: perfect competition and monopoly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 261 - If there is money to be made, new firms will enter the market, increase supply, drive prices down, and thereby eliminate the profits that attracted them in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 263 - Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 272 - The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 274 - How much of the world is actually monopolistic? How much is truly competitive? It’s hard to say, because our common conversation about these matters is so confused. To the outside observer, all businesses can seem reasonably alike, so it’s easy to perceive only small differences between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 282 - Monopolists lie to protect themselves. They know that bragging about their great monopoly invites being audited, scrutinized, and attacked. Since</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 299 - Entrepreneurs are always biased to understate the scale of competition, but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make. The fatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 315 - No screenwriter wants to admit that her new movie script simply rehashes what has already been done before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 316 - Rather, the pitch is: “This film will combine various exciting elements in entirely new ways.” It could even be true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 331 - If you offer affordable food with low margins, you can probably pay employees only minimum wage. And you’ll need to squeeze out every efficiency: that’s why small restaurants put Grandma to work at the register and make the kids wash dishes in the back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 338 - Google’s motto—“Don’t be evil”—is in part a branding ploy, but it’s also characteristic of a kind of business that’s successful enough to take ethics seriously without jeopardizing its own existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 340 - In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 350 - Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world. Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for making it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 357 - The dynamism of new monopolies itself explains why old monopolies don’t strangle innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 369 - Whatever your views on thermodynamics, it’s a powerful metaphor: in business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death. If your industry is in a competitive equilibrium, the death of your business won’t matter to the world; some other undifferentiated competitor will always be ready to take your place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 375 - Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 376 - Business is the opposite. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 381 - So why do people believe that competition is healthy? The answer is that competition is not just an economic concept or a simple inconvenience that individuals and companies must deal with in the marketplace. More than anything else, competition is an ideology—the ideology—that pervades our society and distorts our thinking. We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it—even though the more we compete, the less we gain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 407 - Professors downplay the cutthroat culture of academia, but managers never tire of comparing business to war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 408 - MBA students carry around copies of Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. War metaphors invade our everyday business language: we use headhunters to build up a sales force that will enable us to take a captive market and make a killing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 412 - According to Marx, people fight because they are different. The proletariat fights the bourgeoisie because they have completely different ideas and goals (generated, for Marx, by their very different material circumstances). The greater the differences, the greater the conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 415 - It’s not at all clear why they should be fighting, since they have nothing to fight about. Consider the opening line from Romeo and Juliet: “Two households, both alike in dignity.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 415 - It’s not at all clear why they should be fighting, since they have nothing to fight about. Consider the opening line from Romeo and Juliet: “Two households, both alike in dignity.” The two houses are alike, yet they hate each other. They grow even more similar as the feud escalates. Eventually, they lose sight</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 425 - As a startup, each clan had been content to leave the other alone and prosper independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 425 - As a startup, each clan had been content to leave the other alone and prosper independently. But as they grew, they began to focus on each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 431 - In October 2010, a startup called Square released a small, white, square-shaped product that let anyone with an iPhone swipe and accept credit cards. It was the first good payment processing solution for mobile handsets. Imitators promptly sprang into action. A Canadian company called NetSecure launched its own card reader in a half-moon shape. Intuit brought a cylindrical reader to the geometric battle. In March 2012, eBay’s PayPal unit launched its own copycat card reader. It was shaped like a triangle—a clear jab at Square, as three sides are simpler than four. One gets the sense that this Shakespearean saga won’t end until the apes run out of shapes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 439 - If you’re interested in making things or programming computers, you’ll be less afraid to pursue those activities single-mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 442 - Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 451 - Ellison and Siebel spent the second half of the ’90s trying to sabotage each other. At one point, Ellison sent truckloads of ice cream sandwiches to Siebel’s headquarters to try to convince Siebel employees to jump ship. The copy on the wrappers? “Summer is near. Oracle is here. To brighten your day and your career.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 453 - The copy on the wrappers? “Summer is near. Oracle is here. To brighten your day and your career.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 454 - My Note: The idea  of competition at Oracle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 464 - If you can’t beat a rival, it may be better to merge. I started Confinity with my co-founder Max Levchin in 1998. When we released the PayPal product in late 1999, Elon Musk’s X.com was right on our heels: our companies’ offices were four blocks apart on University Avenue in Palo Alto, and X’s product mirrored ours feature-for-feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 473 - Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that’s true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don’t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 475 - Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death, and danger dare, Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honor’s at the stake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 491 - Simply stated, the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 491 - Simply stated, the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future. (To properly value a business, you also have to discount those future cash flows to their present worth, since a given amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.) Comparing discounted cash flows shows the difference between low-growth businesses and high-growth startups at its starkest. Most of the value of low-growth businesses is in the near term. An Old Economy business (like a newspaper) might hold its value if it can maintain its current cash flows for five or six years. However, any firm with close substitutes will see its profits competed away. Nightclubs or restaurants are extreme examples: successful ones might collect healthy amounts today, but their cash flows will probably dwindle over the next few years when customers move on to newer and trendier alternatives. Technology companies follow the opposite trajectory. They often lose money for the first few years: it takes time to build valuable things, and that means delayed revenue. Most of a tech company’s value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 509 - The overwhelming importance of future profits is counterintuitive even in Silicon Valley. For a company to be valuable it must grow and endure, but many entrepreneurs focus only on short-term growth. They have an excuse: growth is easy to measure, but durability isn’t. Those</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 514 - Zynga scored early wins with games like Farmville and claimed to have a “psychometric engine” to rigorously gauge the appeal of new releases. But they ended up with the same problem as every Hollywood studio: how can you reliably produce a constant stream of popular entertainment for a fickle audience?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 522 - Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 526 - Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 526 - Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. Google’s search algorithms, for example,</p>

<li>
<p>loc 526 - Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. Google’s search algorithms, for example, return results better than anyone else’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 530 - As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 550 - Network effects can be powerful, but you’ll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 556 - successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don’t even appear to be business opportunities at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 560 - Software startups can enjoy especially dramatic economies of scale because the marginal cost of producing another copy of the product is close to zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 562 - If you own a yoga studio, for example, you’ll only be able to serve a certain number of customers. You can hire more instructors and expand to more locations, but your margins will remain fairly low and you’ll never reach a point where a core group of talented people can provide something of value to millions of separate clients, as software engineers are able to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 568 - company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly. Today’s strongest tech brand is Apple: the attractive looks and carefully chosen materials of products like the iPhone and MacBook, the Apple Stores’ sleek minimalist design and close control over the consumer experience, the omnipresent advertising campaigns, the price positioning as a maker of premium goods, and the lingering nimbus of Steve Jobs’s personal charisma all contribute to a perception that Apple offers products so good as to constitute a category of their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 587 - Brand, scale, network effects, and technology in some combination define a monopoly; but to get them to work, you need to choose your market carefully and expand deliberately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 589 - Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 598 - The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 600 - entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market. In practice, a large market will either lack a good starting point or it will be open to competition, so it’s hard to ever reach that 1%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 622 - Originally, “disruption” was a term of art to describe how a firm can use new technology to introduce a low-end product at low prices, improve the product over time, and eventually overtake even the premium products offered by incumbent companies using older technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 630 - But if you truly want to make something new, the act of creation is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 632 - Disruption also attracts attention: disruptors are people who look for trouble and find it. Disruptive kids get sent to the principal’s office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 642 - You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first entrant into a market, you can capture significant market share while competitors scramble to get started. But moving first is a tactic, not a goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 646 - The way to do that is to dominate a small niche and scale up from there, toward your ambitious long-term vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 647 - to succeed, “you must study the endgame before everything else.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 653 - Jeff Bezos attributes Amazon’s success to an “incredible planetary alignment” and jokes that it was “half luck, half good timing, and the rest brains.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 668 - From the Renaissance and the Enlightenment to the mid-20th century, luck was something to be mastered, dominated, and controlled; everyone agreed that you should do what you could, not focus on what you couldn’t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 669 - Ralph Waldo Emerson captured this ethos when he wrote: “Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances.… Strong men believe in cause and effect.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 670 - “Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances.… Strong men believe in cause and effect.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 679 - If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled</p>

<p>loc 679 - If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you’ll give up on trying to master it.</p>

<p>loc 683 - In high school, ambitious students compete even harder to appear omnicompetent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 686 - A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 694 - An indefinite pessimist looks out onto a bleak future, but he has no idea what to do about it. This describes Europe since the early 1970s, when the continent succumbed to undirected bureaucratic drift. Today</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 698 - The indefinite pessimist can’t know whether the inevitable decline will be fast or slow, catastrophic or gradual. All he can do is wait for it to happen, so he might as well eat, drink, and be merry in the meantime: hence Europe’s famous vacation mania.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 701 - A definite pessimist believes the future can be known, but since it will be bleak, he must prepare for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 705 - China can grow so fast only because its starting base is so low. The easiest way for China to grow is to relentlessly copy what has already worked in the West. And that’s exactly what it’s doing: executing definite plans by burning ever more coal to build ever more factories and skyscrapers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 714 - To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 736 - But would anybody today take such a vision seriously in the first place? In the 1950s, people welcomed big plans and asked whether they would work. Today a grand plan coming from a schoolteacher would be dismissed as crankery,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 742 - After a brief pessimistic phase in the 1970s, indefinite optimism has dominated American thinking ever since 1982, when a long bull market began and finance eclipsed engineering as the way to approach the future. To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn’t know how exactly, so he won’t make any specific plans.</p>

<p>loc 761 - they point to the power of a particular individual’s context as determined by chance. But they miss the even bigger social context for their own preferred explanations: a whole generation learned from childhood to overrate the power of chance and underrate the importance of planning.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 766 - definitely optimistic future would need engineers to design underwater cities and settlements in space, an indefinitely optimistic future calls for more bankers and lawyers.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 767 - Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it’s the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 778 - At no point does anyone in the chain know what to do with money in the real economy. But in an indefinite world, people actually prefer unlimited optionality; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it. Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 789 - To increase discretionary spending we’d need definite plans to solve specific problems. But according to the indefinite logic of entitlement spending, we can make things better just by sending out more checks.</p>

<p>loc 793 - The philosophy of the ancient world was pessimistic: Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Lucretius all accepted strict limits on human potential. The only question was how best to cope with our tragic fate.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 838 - Then everyone else imitates the professors’ indefinite attitude. It’s easy for libertarians to claim that heavy regulation holds biotech back—and it does—but indefinite optimism may pose an even greater challenge for the future of biotech.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 841 - What kind of future will our indefinitely optimistic decisions bring about? If American households were saving, at least they could expect to have money to spend later. And if American companies were investing, they could expect to reap the rewards of new wealth in the future. But U.S. households are saving almost nothing. And U.S. companies are letting cash pile up on their balance sheets without investing in new projects because they don’t have any concrete plans for the future.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 846 - Definite pessimism works by building what can be copied without expecting anything new. Indefinite pessimism works because it’s self-fulfilling: if you’re a slacker with low expectations, they’ll probably be met.</p>

<p>loc 892 - Albert Einstein made the same observation when he stated that compound interest was “the eighth wonder of the world,” “the greatest mathematical discovery of all time,” or even “the most powerful force in the universe.” Whichever version you prefer, you can’t miss his message: never underestimate exponential growth. Actually, there’s no evidence that Einstein ever said any of those things—the quotations are all apocryphal.</p>

<p>loc 899 - economist Vilfredo Pareto discovered what became the “Pareto principle,” or the 80-20 rule, when he noticed that 20% of the people owned 80% of the land in Italy—a phenomenon that he found just as natural as the fact that 20% of the peapods in his garden produced 80% of the peas.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 905 - This chapter shows how the power law becomes visible when you follow the money: in venture capital, where investors try to profit from exponential growth in early-stage companies, a few companies attain exponentially greater value than all others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 912 - A venture fund makes money when the companies in its portfolio become more valuable and either go public or get bought by larger companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 915 - VCs hope the value of the fund will increase dramatically in a few years’ time, to break-even and beyond, when the successful portfolio companies hit their exponential growth spurts and start to scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 920 - The error lies in expecting that venture returns will be normally distributed: that is, bad companies will fail, mediocre ones will stay flat, and good ones will return 2x or even 4x.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 923 - But this “spray and pray” approach usually produces an entire portfolio of flops, with no hits at all. This is because venture returns don’t follow a normal distribution overall. Rather, they follow a power law: a small handful of companies radically outperform all others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 930 - The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.</p>

<p>loc 940 - VCs must find the handful of companies that will successfully go from 0 to 1 and then back them with every resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 944 - Whenever you shift from the substance of a business to the financial question of whether or not it fits into a diversified hedging strategy, venture investing starts to look a lot like buying lottery tickets. And once you think that you’re playing the lottery, you’ve already psychologically prepared yourself to lose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 963 - After all, less than 1% of new businesses started each year in the U.S. receive venture funding, and total VC investment accounts for less than 0.2% of GDP. But the results of those investments disproportionately propel the entire economy. Venture-backed companies create 11% of all private sector jobs. They generate annual revenues equivalent to an astounding 21% of GDP. Indeed, the dozen largest tech companies were all venture-backed. Together those 12 companies are worth more than $2 trillion, more than all other tech companies combined.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 990 - If you do start your own company, you must remember the power law to operate it well. The most important things are singular: One market will probably be better than all others, as we discussed in Chapter 5. One distribution strategy usually dominates all others, too—for that see Chapter 11.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 993 - However, you can’t trust a world that denies the power law to accurately frame your decisions for you, so what’s most important is rarely obvious. It might even be secret. But in a power law world, you can’t afford not to think hard about where your actions will fall on the curve.</p>

Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable. If there are many secrets left in the world, there are probably many world-changing companies yet to be started.</p>

<p>loc 1098 - You can’t find secrets without looking for them. Andrew Wiles demonstrated this when he proved Fermat’s Last Theorem after 358 years of fruitless inquiry by other mathematicians—the kind of sustained failure that might have suggested an inherently impossible task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1103 - Wiles started working on it in 1986, but he kept it a secret until 1993, when he knew he was nearing a solution. After nine years of hard work, Wiles proved the conjecture in 1995. He needed brilliance to succeed, but he also needed a faith in secrets. If you think something hard is impossible, you’ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets is an effective truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1111 - we will never learn any of these secrets unless we demand to know them and force ourselves to look.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1122 - There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people. Natural secrets exist all around us; to find them, one must study some undiscovered aspect of the physical world. Secrets about people are different: they are things that people don’t know about themselves or things they hide because they don’t want others to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1138 - The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking. Most people think only in terms of what they’ve been taught; schooling itself aims to impart conventional wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1148 - The few who knew what might be learned, Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show, And reveal their feelings to the crowd below, Mankind has always crucified and burned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1153 - The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator. As Tolkien wrote in The Lord of the Rings: The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 1194 - every other psychologist has a theory about how every individual mind is divided against itself, but in business at least, working for yourself guarantees alignment. Unfortunately, it also limits what kind of company you can build. It’s very hard to go from 0 to 1 without a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1201 - You need good people who get along, but you also need a structure to help keep everyone aligned for the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1202 - To anticipate likely sources of misalignment in any company, it’s useful to distinguish between three concepts: • Ownership: who legally owns a company’s equity? • Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis? • Control: who formally governs the company’s affairs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1207 - In theory, this division works smoothly. Financial upside from part ownership attracts and rewards investors and workers. Effective possession motivates and empowers founders and employees—it means they can get stuff done. Oversight from the board places managers’ plans in a broader perspective. In practice, distributing these functions among different people makes sense, but it also multiplies opportunities for misalignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1219 - Big corporations do better than the DMV, but they’re still prone to misalignment, especially between ownership and possession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1219 - Big corporations do better than the DMV, but they’re still prone to misalignment, especially between ownership and possession. The CEO of a huge company like General Motors, for example, will own some of the company’s stock, but only a trivial portion of the total. Therefore he’s incentivized to reward himself through the power of possession rather than the value of ownership. Posting good quarterly results will be enough for him to keep his high salary and corporate jet. Misalignment can creep in even if he receives stock compensation in the name of “shareholder value.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1225 - Unlike corporate giants, early-stage startups are small enough that founders usually have both ownership and possession. Most conflicts in a startup erupt between ownership and control—that is, between founders and investors on the board. The potential for conflict increases over time as interests diverge: a board member might want to take a company public as soon as possible to score a win for his venture firm, while the founders would prefer to stay private and grow the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1232 - A board of three is ideal. Your board should never exceed five people, unless your company is publicly held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1235 - Actually, a huge board will exercise no effective oversight at all; it merely provides cover for whatever microdictator actually runs the organization. If you want that kind of free rein from your board, blow it up to giant size. If you want an effective board, keep it small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1240 - However, anyone who doesn’t own stock options or draw a regular salary from your company is fundamentally misaligned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1240 - However, anyone who doesn’t own stock options or draw a regular salary from your company is fundamentally misaligned. At the margin, they’ll be biased to claim value in the near term, not help you create more in the future. That’s why hiring consultants doesn’t work. Part-time employees don’t work. Even working remotely should be avoided, because misalignment can creep in whenever colleagues aren’t together full-time, in the same place, every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1246 - A company does better the less it pays the CEO—that’s one of the single clearest patterns I’ve noticed from investing in hundreds of startups. In no case should a CEO of an early-stage, venture-backed startup receive more than $150,000 per year in salary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1251 - A cash-poor executive, by contrast, will focus on increasing the value of the company as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1254 - If a CEO doesn’t set an example by taking the lowest salary in the company, he can do the same thing by drawing the highest salary. So long as that figure is still modest, it sets an effective ceiling on cash compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1258 - cash bonus is slightly better than a cash salary—at least it’s contingent on a job well done. But even so-called incentive pay encourages short-term thinking and value grabbing.

<p>loc 1281 - The founding moment of a company, however, really does happen just once: only at the very start do you have the opportunity to set the rules that will align people toward the creation of value in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1283 - The most valuable kind of company maintains an openness to invention that is most characteristic of beginnings. This leads to a second, less obvious understanding of the founding: it lasts as long as a company is creating new things, and it ends when creation stops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1288 - START WITH A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT: what would the ideal company culture look like? Employees should love their work. They should enjoy going to the office so much that formal business hours become obsolete and nobody watches the clock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1296 - A startup is a team of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like on the inside. BEYOND PROFESSIONALISM The first team that I built has become known in Silicon Valley as the “PayPal Mafia” because so many of my former colleagues have gone on to help each other start and invest in successful tech companies.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 1296 - A startup is a team of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like on the inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1304 - We didn’t assemble a mafia by sorting through résumés and simply hiring the most talented people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1310 - If you can’t count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven’t invested your time well—even in purely financial terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1312 - I thought stronger relationships would make us not just happier and better at work but also more successful in our careers even beyond PayPal. So we set out to hire people who would actually enjoy working together. They had to be talented, but even more than that they had to be excited about working specifically with us. That was the start of the PayPal Mafia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1316 - Recruiting is a core competency for any company. It should never be outsourced. You need people who are not just skilled on paper but who will work together cohesively after they’re hired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1320 - Why would someone join your company as its 20th engineer when she could go work at Google for more money and more prestige?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1325 - But there are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1329 - However, even a great mission is not enough. The kind of recruit who would be most engaged as an employee will also wonder: “Are these the kind of people I want to work with?” You should be able to explain why your company is a unique match for him personally. And if you can’t do that, he’s probably not the right match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1342 - everyone at your company should be different in the same way—a tribe of like-minded people fiercely devoted to the company’s mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1343 - Max Levchin, my co-founder at PayPal, says that startups should make their early staff as personally similar as possible. Startups have limited resources and small teams. They must work quickly and efficiently in order to survive, and that’s easier to do when everyone shares an understanding of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1350 - On the inside, every individual should be sharply distinguished by her work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1353 - But it’s also because job assignments aren’t just about the relationships between workers and tasks; they’re also about relationships between employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1357 - But then I noticed a deeper result: defining roles reduced conflict. Most fights inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the same responsibilities. Startups face an especially high risk of this since job roles are fluid at the early stages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1363 - In the most intense kind of organization, members hang out only with other members. They ignore their families and abandon the outside world. In exchange, they experience strong feelings of belonging, and maybe get access to esoteric “truths” denied to ordinary people. We have a word for such organizations: cults. Cultures of total dedication look crazy from the outside, partly because the most notorious cults were homicidal: Jim Jones and Charles Manson did not make good exits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1372 - The best startups might be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults. The biggest difference is that cults tend to be fanatically wrong about something important. People at a successful startup are fanatically right about something those outside it have missed. You’re</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1383 - Distribution may not matter in fictional worlds, but it matters in ours. We underestimate the importance of distribution—a catchall term for everything it takes to sell a product—because we share the same bias the A Ship and C Ship people had: salespeople and other “middlemen” supposedly get in the way, and distribution should flow magically from the creation of a good product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1392 - In Silicon Valley, nerds are skeptical of advertising, marketing, and sales because they seem superficial and irrational. But advertising matters because it works. It works on nerds, and it works on you. You may think that you’re an exception; that your preferences are authentic, and advertising only works on other people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1399 - Sales is the opposite: an orchestrated campaign to change surface appearances without changing the underlying reality. This strikes engineers as trivial if not fundamentally dishonest. They know their own jobs are hard, so when they look at salespeople laughing on the phone with a customer or going to two-hour lunches, they suspect that no real work is being done. If anything, people overestimate the relative difficulty of science and engineering, because the challenges of those fields are obvious. What nerds miss is that it takes hard work to make sales look easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1410 - Like acting, sales works best when hidden. This explains why almost everyone whose job involves distribution—whether they’re in sales, marketing, or advertising—has a job title that has nothing to do with those things.</p>

<p>loc 1410 - Like acting, sales works best when hidden. This explains why almost everyone whose job involves distribution—whether they’re in sales, marketing, or advertising—has a job title that has nothing to do with those things. People who sell advertising are called “account executives.” People who sell customers work in “business development.” People who sell companies are “investment bankers.” And people who sell themselves are called “politicians.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1418 - The most fundamental reason that even businesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the systematic effort to hide it at every level of every field in a world secretly driven by it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1422 - The polar opposite business cliché warns that “the best product doesn’t always win.” Economists attribute this to “path dependence”: specific historical circumstances independent of objective quality can determine which products enjoy widespread adoption. That’s true, but it doesn’t mean the operating systems we use today and the keyboard layouts on which we type were imposed by mere chance. It’s better to think of distribution as something essential to the design of your product. If you’ve invented something new but you haven’t invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business—no matter how good the product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1430 - Two metrics set the limits for effective distribution.

<p>loc 1441 - Unsurprisingly, members of Congress don’t want to give up federal funds going to their home districts. But since complex sales requires making just a few deals each year, a sales grandmaster like Elon Musk can use that time to focus on the most crucial people—and even to overcome political inertia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1445 - Instead, Alex, who is Palantir’s CEO, spends 25 days a month on the road, meeting with clients and potential clients. Our deal sizes range from $1 million to $100 million. At that price point, buyers want to talk to the CEO, not the VP of Sales.</p>

<p>loc 1451 - Once you have a pool of reference customers who are successfully using your product, then you can begin the long and methodical work of hustling toward ever bigger deals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1462 - A complex sales approach would have made Box a forgotten startup failure; instead, personal sales made it a multibillion-dollar business.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 1470 - In between personal sales (salespeople obviously required) and traditional advertising (no salespeople required) there is a dead zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1474 - The product needs a personal sales effort, but at that price point, you simply don’t have the resources to send an actual person to talk to every prospective customer. This is why so many small and medium-sized businesses don’t use tools that bigger firms take for granted. It’s not that small business proprietors are unusually backward or that good tools don’t exist: distribution is the hidden bottleneck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1499 - A product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends to become users too. This is how Facebook and PayPal both grew quickly: every time someone shares with a friend or makes a payment, they naturally invite more and more people into the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1506 - This strategy cost us $20 per customer, but it also led to 7% daily growth, which meant that our user base nearly doubled every 10 days. After four or five months, we had hundreds of thousands of users and a viable opportunity to build a great company by servicing money transfers for small fees that ended up greatly exceeding our customer acquisition cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1519 - But the kitchen sink approach—employ a few salespeople, place some magazine ads, and try to add some kind of viral functionality to the product as an afterthought—doesn’t work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1520 - Most businesses get zero distribution channels to work: poor sales rather than bad product is the most common cause of failure. If you can get just one distribution channel to work, you have a great business. If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1524 - There is a “human resources” version of the lie that great products sell themselves: “This company is so good that people will be clamoring to join it.” And there’s a fundraising version too: “This company is so great that investors will be banging down our door to invest.” Clamor and frenzy are very real, but they rarely happen without calculated recruiting and pitching beneath the surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1527 - Selling your company to the media is a necessary part of selling it to everyone else. Nerds who instinctively mistrust the media often make the mistake of trying to ignore it. But just as you can never expect people to buy a superior product merely on its obvious merits without any distribution strategy, you should never assume that people will admire your company without a public relations strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1533 - Nerds might wish that distribution could be ignored and salesmen banished to another planet. All of us want to believe that we make up our own minds, that sales doesn’t work on us. But it’s not true. Everybody has a product to sell—no matter whether you’re an employee, a founder, or an investor. It’s true even if your company consists of just you and your computer. Look around. If you don’t see any salespeople, you’re the salesperson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1550 - Futurists can seem like they hope the answer is yes. Luddites are so worried about being replaced that they would rather we stop building new technology altogether. Neither side questions the premise that better computers will necessarily replace human workers. But that premise is wrong: computers are complements for humans, not substitutes. The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete. SUBSTITUTION VS.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 1565 - People don’t just compete to supply labor; they also demand the same resources. While American consumers have benefited from access to cheap toys and textiles from China, they’ve had to pay higher prices for the gasoline newly desired by millions of Chinese motorists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1581 - The stark differences between man and machine mean that gains from working with computers are much higher than gains from trade with other people. We don’t trade with computers any more than we trade with livestock or lamps. And that’s the point: computers are tools, not rivals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1586 - Properly understood, technology is the one way for us to escape competition in a globalizing world. As computers become more and more powerful, they won’t be substitutes for humans: they’ll be complements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1597 - The fraudsters’ adaptive evasions fooled our automatic detection algorithms, but we found that they didn’t fool our human analysts as easily. So Max and his engineers rewrote the software to take a hybrid approach: the computer would flag the most suspicious transactions on a well-designed user interface, and human operators would make the final judgment as to their legitimacy. Thanks to this hybrid system—we named it “Igor,” after the Russian fraudster who bragged that we’d never be able to stop him—we turned our first quarterly profit in the first quarter of 2002 (as opposed to a quarterly loss of $29.3 million one year before).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1603 - This kind of man-machine symbiosis enabled PayPal to stay in business, which in turn enabled hundreds of thousands of small businesses to accept the payments they needed to thrive on the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1618 - In addition to helping find terrorists, analysts using Palantir’s software have been able to predict where insurgents plant IEDs in Afghanistan; prosecute high-profile insider trading cases; take down the largest child pornography ring in the world; support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in fighting foodborne disease outbreaks; and save both commercial banks and the government hundreds of millions of dollars annually through advanced fraud detection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1627 - Computers might be able to do some of these tasks, but they can’t combine them effectively. Better technology in law, medicine, and education won’t replace professionals; it will allow them to do even more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1636 - Why do so many people miss the power of complementarity? It starts in school. Software engineers tend to work on projects that replace human efforts because that’s what they’re trained to do. Academics make their reputations through specialized research; their primary goal is to publish papers, and publication means respecting the limits of a particular discipline. For computer scientists, that means reducing human capabilities into specialized tasks that computers can be trained to conquer one by one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1647 - Computers can find patterns that elude humans, but they don’t know how to compare patterns from different sources or how to interpret complex behaviors. Actionable insights can only come from a human analyst (or the kind of generalized artificial intelligence that exists only in science fiction).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1660 - Strong AI is like a cosmic lottery ticket: if we win, we get utopia; if we lose, Skynet substitutes us out of existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1663 - Indefinite fears about the far future shouldn’t stop us from making definite plans today. Luddites claim that we shouldn’t build the computers that might replace people someday; crazed futurists argue that we should. These two positions are mutually exclusive but they are not exhaustive: there is room in between for sane people to build a vastly better world in the decades ahead. As we find new ways to use computers, they won’t just get better at the kinds of things people already do; they’ll help us to do what was previously unimaginable.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 1692 - We’ve discussed these elements before. Whatever your industry, any great business plan must address every one of them. If you don’t have good answers to these questions, you’ll run into lots of “bad luck” and your business will fail. If you nail all seven, you’ll master fortune and succeed. Even getting five or six correct might work. But the striking thing about the cleantech bubble was that people were starting companies with zero good answers—and that meant hoping for a miracle.</p>

This was a huge red flag, because real technologists wear T-shirts and jeans. So we instituted a blanket rule: pass on any company whose founders dressed up for pitch meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1754 - The best sales is hidden. There’s nothing wrong with a CEO who can sell, but if he actually looks like a salesman, he’s probably bad at sales and worse at tech.</p>

<p>loc 1758 - They learned the hard way that the world is not a laboratory: selling and delivering a product is at least as important as the product itself.</p>

<p>loc 1803 - Great companies have secrets: specific reasons for success that other people don’t see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1810 - The ambiguity between social and financial goals doesn’t help. But the ambiguity in the word “social” is even more of a problem: if something is “socially good,” is it good for society, or merely seen as good by society? Whatever is good enough to receive applause from all audiences can only be conventional, like the general idea of green energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1815 - Doing something different is what’s truly good for society—and it’s also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market. The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1940 - Who makes an effective scapegoat? Like founders, scapegoats are extreme and contradictory figures. On the one hand, a scapegoat is necessarily weak; he is powerless to stop his own victimization. On the other hand, as the one who can defuse conflict by taking the blame, he is the most powerful member of the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1955 - For some fallen stars, death brings resurrection. So many popular musicians have died at age 27—Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain, for example—that this set has become immortalized as the “27 Club.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1987 - Just as the legal attack on Microsoft was ending Bill Gates’s dominance, Steve Jobs’s return to Apple demonstrated the irreplaceable value of a company’s founder. In some ways, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were opposites. Jobs was an artist, preferred closed systems, and spent his time thinking about great products above all else; Gates was a businessman, kept his products open, and wanted to run the world. But both were insider/outsiders, and both pushed the companies they started to achievements that nobody else would have been able to match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1998 - That year Michael Dell famously said of Apple, “What would I do? I’d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.” Instead Jobs introduced the iPod (2001), the iPhone (2007), and the iPad (2010) before he had to resign in 2011 because of poor health. By the following year Apple was the single most valuable company in the world.</p>

<p>loc 2003 - A unique founder can make authoritative decisions, inspire strong personal loyalty, and plan ahead for decades. Paradoxically, impersonal bureaucracies staffed by trained professionals can last longer than any lifetime, but they usually act with short time horizons.</p>

But an equally insidious danger for every business is to lose all sense of myth and mistake disenchantment for wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2032 - Recurrent collapse seems unlikely: the knowledge underlying civilization is so widespread today that complete annihilation would be more probable than a long period of darkness followed by recovery. However, in case of extinction, there is no human future of any kind to consider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2038 - However, when you add competition to consume scarce resources, it’s hard to see how a global plateau could last indefinitely. Without new technology to relieve competitive pressures, stagnation is likely to erupt into conflict. In case of conflict on a global scale, stagnation collapses into extinction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2041 - That leaves the fourth scenario, in which we create new technology to make a much better future. The most dramatic version of this outcome is called the Singularity, an attempt to name the imagined result of new technologies so powerful as to transcend the current limits of our understanding. Ray Kurzweil, the best-known Singularitarian, starts from Moore’s law and traces exponential growth trends in dozens of fields, confidently projecting a future of superhuman artificial intelligence. According to Kurzweil, “the Singularity is near,” it’s inevitable, and all we have to do is prepare ourselves to accept</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2050 - Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.</p>
