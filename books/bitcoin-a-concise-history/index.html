<p>loc 65 - March 9, 1993 Eric Hughes publishes The Cypherpunk’s Manifesto, a statement of intent and philosophy from a group of coders and technophiles known as the Cypherpunks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 104 - #bitcoin-dev becomes available on Internet Relay Chat (IRC).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 107 - 2011. BitcoinTalk will serve as a vital source of news, discussion, debate, and important announcements for the Bitcoin community, and will remain relevant even after alternative news sources come into being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 122 - May 22, 2010 On the BitcoinTalk Forum, Laszlo Hanyecz offers 10,000 BTC to someone who would order him a pizza.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 133 - August 15, 2010 Hackers use a vulnerability in the Bitcoin software to produce 184 billion BTC. Developers patch the vulnerability and address the problem of the billions of extraneous BTC by forking the blockchain at a point prior to when the exploit occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 151 - December 12, 2010 On this day, Satoshi Nakamoto makes his last contribution to the BitcoinTalk Forum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 155 - Price of BTC on January 1, 2011: $0.30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 165 - February 9, 2011 Bitcoin reaches parity with the US Dollar on the MtGox website (1 BTC= 1 USD).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 189 - June 1, 2011 News website Gawker publishes an article entitled “The Underground Website Where You Can Buy Any Drug Imaginable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 196 - June 8, 2011 BTC reaches $31.91; having tripled in less than one week since the release of the Gawker article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 199 - June 12, 2011 The value of Bitcoin plummets to $4 USD. This drop, known as the Great Bubble of 2011, fails to shake confidence in the currency. Demand for BTC climbs, causing it to regain and exceed its previous value in subsequent weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 208 - June 15, 2011 Mt. Gox is hacked, possibly by a someone accessing the account of an auditor. The hacker attempts to sell a large amount of BTC which causes the exchange rate to plummet to one cent, allowing others to purchase BTC at an artificially low price. The hack also compromises the email addresses, passwords, and other sensitive information associated with user accounts. This information will later be released to the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 214 - July 28, 2011 On this day, the Bitcoin exchange Kraken is established.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 230 - November 2011 Trendon Shavers, aka “pirateat40” opens Bitcoin Savings and Trust, advertising a weekly interest rate of 7%. This rate would allow investors&rsquo; funds to double every 10 weeks. Despite being an obvious Ponzi scheme, there are no shortage of depositors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 238 - Price of BTC on January 1, 2012: $5.27 Bitcoin acceptance grows… as does the number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 238 - Price of BTC on January 1, 2012: $5.27</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 243 - February 13, 2012 TradeHill, the world&rsquo;s second largest Bitcoin exchange after Mt. Gox, shuts down after losing $100,000 in a dispute with a payment processor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 247 - February 27, 2012 Bitcoin Magazine is launched by Vitalik Buterin and Mihai Alisie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 250 - March 1, 2012 The Bitcoinica trading market is hacked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 253 - March 5, 2012 TradeHill sues the financial transfer service Dwolla. Less than one month prior to this, TradeHill had ceased operating, largely because it lost over $100,000 to a payment processor. The payment processor was not named but is speculated to be Dwolla.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 256 - April 24, 2012 Eric Voorhees launches SatoshiDice, a Bitcoin gambling service. The service operates in defiance of US Laws against gambling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 260 - May 11, 2012 Bitcoinica is hacked again, this time for over 18,000 Bitcoins, worth over $92,000. Bitcoinica ceases trading and promises to refund 50% of customer funds. The refund never materializes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 262 - June 2012 Jeremias Kangas creates the startup LocalBitcoins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 266 - June 20, 2012 Coinbase is established by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam as a platform where users can exchange Bitcoin for fiat currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 269 - August 17, 2012 Bitcoin Savings and Trust halts interest payments. It officially defaults on August 29th. The owner, Trendon “Pirate40” Shavers, vanishes with 140,000 BTC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 277 - November 15, 2012 Wordpress, preeminent blog host and provider of popular blogging software, begins accepting bitcoin payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 279 - 2012 The first &ldquo;Halving Day.&rdquo; The number of BTC generated as a “reward” to miners who successfully write a block of transactions to the blockchain is reduced by half, from 50 to 25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 284 - Price of BTC on January 1, 2013: $13.30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 289 - January 25, 2013 Shaun Bridges, a federal investigator tasked with cracking the Silk Road website, speaks with Silk Road moderator Curtis Green. Green agrees to cooperate and gave Bridges and his colleagues information for how to log into Silk Road&rsquo;s user accounts. Within hours, significant thefts from Silk Road are reported and attributed to Curtis Green. However, they are later found to be the work of agent Shaun Bridges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 292 - March 11, 2013 Bitcoin developers inadvertently release a version of the Bitcoin client that is incompatible with prior versions. This causes a fork in the blockchain, with miners and users who did not upgrade to the new version existing on a separate chain from those who upgraded. Users on the “upgraded” chain are forced to downgrade to a previous version of Bitcoin, which causes some miners to lose profits earned on the new chain. This is a serious blow the confidence and price of Bitcoin, however the impact on both is short-lived. After a dip, the price resumes its upward climb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 304 - April 23, 2013 Adam B. Levine launches the &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk Bitcoin&rdquo; podcast, featuring himself, Andreas Antonopoulos, and Dr. Stephanie Murphy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 318 - October 2013 Bitcoin exchange Circle is launched by entrepreneurs Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 329 - October 29, 2013 The first Bitcoin ATM goes online in downtown Vancouver at a Waves coffee shop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 335 - November 21, 2013 The Cypriot University of Nicosia becomes the first university in the world to accept bitcoin as payment for tuition in a move the school called the Digital Currency Initiative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 338 - November 29, 2013 Bitcoin reaches $1242 on MtGox. This is the height of the Bitcoin Bubble (some say it is the Third Bitcoin Bubble, counting previous spikes in 2011 and in April of 2013). The BTC price will decline significantly from this point, and will not reach this level again until 2017.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 349 - December 5, 2013 China&rsquo;s central bank, the Bank of China, bans any transactions using Bitcoin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 350 - December 8, 2013 Dogecoin, a meme-inspired derivative of Bitcoin, debuts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 358 - December 18, 2013 BitcoinTalk user GameKyuubi makes a rambling drunken post entitled “I AM HODLING”, which shouts the virtues of holding BTC in the midst of the current sharp downtrend in price. His misspelled admonition to “HODL” becomes an internet meme and remains the most popular Bitcoin meme to date. In hindsight, GameKyuubi’s advice turns out to have been correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 363 - Price of BTC on January 1, 2014: $770.44</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 366 - January 27, 2014 Charlie Shrem, the CEO and co-founder of BitInstant is arrested for conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 368 - February 7, 2014 Mt. Gox halts withdrawals of BTC by its clients, claiming it needs to review its financial processes and fix possible bugs in the software. Unknown by most at this point, Mt. Gox is insolvent due to an ongoing theft that had been occurring since 2011 leading to the loss of over 700,000 BTC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 381 - February 23, 2014 MtGox CEO Mark Karpelès resigns. Mt. Gox ceases all trading activities, and within a few hours, the website is offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 383 - February 24, 2014 Entrepreneur Danny Brewster opens Neo &amp; Bee, a Bitcoin bank and payment processor service in Cyprus. The opening of the first branch comes after an extremely aggressive advertising campaign and a round of crowdfunding that raised 9800 BTC. One month later, citing safety concerns, Brewster flees the country with the remainder of the unspent BTC, leaving employees and vendors unpaid. The Cypriot police issue an arrest warrant, and Brewster remains in hiding (presumably in the UK) until early 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 401 - March 25, 2014 Internal Revenue Service declares that bitcoin will be taxed as property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 406 - June 13, 2014 A single mining collective known as Ghash.io officially controls 51% of the Bitcoin network’s mining power. This is not a scam or a hack, but rather a natural consequence of Ghash.io’s popularity in the fast-growing Bitcoin mining ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 419 - September 8, 2014 Payment processor Braintree, a subsidiary of Paypal, begins accepting bitcoin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 427 - November 12, 2014 Reddit user qwsazxcde1, exuberant about a sudden upward spike in price (to $502), makes a celebratory comment entitled “This Is Gentlemen.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 443 - May 19, 2015 Ross Ulbricht, of Silk Road fame, is sentenced to life in prison</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 450 - July 30, 2015 Ethereum, a crypto-platform with advanced scripting and smart contract functionality is launched by a team of developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 455 - August 8, 2015 New York implements the bitlicense what was announced the previous year. This is the first time that a US-based government would attempt to regulate virtual currency. As a result of the measure, at least a dozen Bitcoin-based operators decline to do business in New York or service customers in the state. By 2017, only three companies will have been granted a bitlicense, although many more have applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 459 - August 15, 2015 Bitcoin Developers Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen release Bitcoin XT, a new version of the standard Bitcoin Core client that allows for larger block sizes that increase over time as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 464 - Bitcoin XT fails to gain sufficient support, and the philosophical debate over scaling mechanisms continues. Members of the community and press half-jokingly refer to the contentious and often vitriolic debate over block size as the Bitcoin Civil War.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 469 - September 18, 2015 The US Commodities Future Trading Commission declares that bitcoin is a commodity, similar to any consumer good, and therefore under the purview of the Commodity Exchange Act. This move falls short of recognizing bitcoin as money and is considered a blatant step by the US government towards regulating it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 472 - September 22, 2015 Bitcoin exchange Circle becomes the first company to receive a New York bitlicense,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 485 - December 1, 2015 The US Securities and Exchange Commission declares Bitcoin mining companies GAWMiners and ZenMiner to be Ponzi schemes. Both companies, and their associated cryptocurrency Paycoin, were founded by Joshua Garza to share the profits made by mining, however, his computers did not have enough processing power to back his claims, leading the SEC to recognize his activities as fraudulent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 489 - December 8, 2015 Wired magazine publishes and article claiming Australian programmer and businessman Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 494 - Price of BTC on January 1, 2016: $434.46</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 496 - January 2016 Bitcoin Unlimited, another fork of the Bitcoin Core client, is released. Like Bitcoin XT, this fork attempts to address the much-debated block size limit. This version of the Bitcoin software does not have a hard-coded limit, instead allowing users to set their own limit with the expectation that a consensus will eventually be reached. Bugs plague Bitcoin Unlimited after release. In early 2017 only 11% of Bitcoin nodes run Bitcoin Unlimited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 504 - February 10, 2016 Bitcoin Classic, a third fork of Bitcoin Core is released. Bitcoin Classic proposes a single increase to the block size from 1MB to 2MB followed by a democratic process to decide on future changes. As with the other two forks (Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Unlimited) Bitcoin Classic falls short of the level of adoption necessary to push its implementation across the main Bitcoin network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 509 - April 4, 2016 Bitcoin-powered Online marketplace OpenBazaar launches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 517 - May 2, 2016</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 520 - Payment processor BitPay announces their prepaid Visa card, a debit card that can be loaded with bitcoin. BTC will be converted to USD at the time the card is loaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 520 - Payment processor BitPay announces their prepaid Visa card, a debit card that can be loaded with bitcoin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 525 - July 13, 2016 Researchers publish a scholarly report entitled &ldquo;The Evolution of the Bitcoin Economy: Extracting and Analyzing the Network of Payment Relationships.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 541 - Price of BTC on January 1, 2017: $1005.42</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 550 - March 10, 2017 The Securities and Exchange Commission denies an application filed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss for their ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. The denial causes a temporary 14% dip in the value of BTC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 562 - May 9, 2017 Australian Department of the Treasury announces it is eliminating the goods-and-services tax (GST) on bitcoin purchases in order to &ldquo;make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia&rdquo;.</p>
