<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 97 - You really only need to know three things to evaluate a CEO’s greatness: the compound annual return to shareholders during his or her tenure and the return over the same period for peer companies and for the broader market (usually measured by the S&amp;P 500).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 125 - He was known as “the Sphinx” for his reluctance to speak with either analysts or journalists, and he never once appeared on the cover of Fortune magazine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 125 - He was known as “the Sphinx” for his reluctance to speak with either analysts or journalists, and he never once appeared</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 136 - His success did not stem from Teledyne’s owning any unique, rapidly growing businesses. Rather, much of what distinguished Singleton from his peers lay in his mastery of the critical but somewhat mysterious field of capital allocation—the process of deciding how to deploy the firm’s resources to earn the best possible return for shareholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 140 - CEOs need to do two things well to be successful: run their operations efficiently and deploy the cash generated by those operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 143 - Basically, CEOs have five essential choices for deploying capital—investing in existing operations, acquiring other businesses, issuing dividends, paying down debt, or repurchasing stock—and three alternatives for raising it—tapping internal cash flow, issuing debt, or raising equity. Think</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 152 - The heads of many companies are not skilled in capital allocation. Their inadequacy is not surprising. Most bosses rise to the top because they have excelled in an area such as marketing, production, engineering, administration, or sometimes, institutional politics. Once they become CEOs, they now must make capital allocation decisions, a critical job that they may have never tackled and that is not easily mastered. To stretch the point, it’s as if the final step for a highly talented musician was not to perform at Carnegie Hall, but instead, to be named Chairman of the Federal Reserve.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 163 - Singleton focused Teledyne’s capital on selective acquisitions and a series of large share repurchases. He was restrained in issuing shares, made frequent use of debt, and did not pay a dividend until the late 1980s. In contrast, the other conglomerates pursued a mirror-image allocation strategy—actively issuing shares to buy companies, paying dividends, avoiding share repurchases, and generally using less debt. In short, they deployed a different set</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 167 - Specifically, he believed in an extreme form of organizational decentralization with a wafer-thin corporate staff at headquarters and operational responsibility and authority concentrated in the general managers of the business units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 183 - I think you will find that a disproportionate number of successful coin-flippers in the investment world came from a very small intellectual village that could be called Graham-and-Doddsville.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 192 - Like Singleton, they developed unique, markedly different approaches to their businesses, typically drawing much comment and questioning from peers and the business press. Even more interestingly, although they developed these principles independently, it turned out they were iconoclastic in virtually identical ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 197 - Call it Singletonville, a very select group of men and women who understood, among other things, that: • Capital allocation is a CEO’s most important job. • What counts in the long run is the increase in per share value, not overall growth or size. • Cash flow, not reported earnings, is what determines longterm value. • Decentralized organizations release entrepreneurial energy and keep both costs and “rancor” down. • Independent thinking is essential to long-term success, and interactions with outside advisers (Wall Street, the press, etc.) can be distracting and time-consuming. • Sometimes the best investment opportunity is your own stock. • With acquisitions, patience is a virtue . . . as is occasional boldness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 260 - The residents of Singletonville, however, represent a refreshing rejoinder to this stereotype. All were first-time CEOs, most with very little prior management experience. Not one came to the job from a high-profile position, and all but one were new to their industries and companies. Only two had MBAs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 291 - Isaiah Berlin, in a famous essay about Leo Tolstoy, introduced the instructive contrast between the “fox,” who knows many things, and the “hedgehog,” who knows one thing but knows it very well. Most CEOs are hedgehogs—they grow up in an industry and by the time they are tapped for the top role, have come to know it thoroughly. There are many positive attributes associated with hedgehogness, including expertise, specialization, and focus. Foxes, however, also have many attractive qualities, including an ability to make connections across fields and to innovate, and the CEOs in this book were definite foxes. They had familiarity with other companies and industries and disciplines, and this ranginess translated into new perspectives, which in turn helped them to develop new approaches that eventually translated into exceptional results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 298 - Warren Buffett looked back on his first twenty-five years as a CEO and concluded that the most important and surprising lesson from his career to date was the discovery of a mysterious force, the corporate equivalent of teenage peer pressure, that impelled CEOs to imitate the actions of their peers. He dubbed this powerful force the institutional imperative and noted that it was nearly ubiquitous, warning that effective CEOs needed to find some way to tune it out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 312 - At bottom, these CEOs thought more like investors than managers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 314 - When their stock was cheap, they bought it (often in large quantities), and when it was expensive, they used it to buy other companies or to raise inexpensive capital to fund future growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 341 - This fox-like outsider’s perspective helped these executives develop differentiated approaches, and it informed their entire management philosophy. As a group, they were deeply independent, generally avoiding communication with Wall Street, disdaining the use of advisers, and preferring decentralized organizational structures that self-selected for other independent thinkers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 365 - For Henry Singleton in the 1970s and 1980s, it was stock buybacks; for John Malone, it was the relentless pursuit of cable subscribers; for Bill Anders, it was divesting noncore businesses; for Warren Buffett, it was the generation and deployment of insurance float.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 367 - At the core of their shared worldview was the belief that the primary goal for any CEO was to optimize long-term value per share, not organizational growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 371 - And yet virtually all of these CEOs shrank their share bases significantly through repurchases. Most also shrank their operations through asset sales or spin-offs, and they were not shy about selling (or closing) underperforming divisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 385 - Tom Murphy and Dan Burke were probably the greatest two-person combination in management that the world has ever seen or maybe ever will see. —Warren Buffett</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 396 - CBS spent much of the 1960s and 1970s taking the enormous cash flow generated by its network and broadcast operations and funding an aggressive acquisition program that led it into entirely new fields, including the purchase of a toy business and the New York Yankees baseball team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 404 - In contrast, Murphy’s goal was to make his company more valuable. As he said to me, “The goal is not to have the longest train, but to arrive at the station first using the least fuel.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 408 - Murphy acquired more radio and TV stations, operated them superbly well, regularly repurchased his shares, and eventually acquired CBS’s rival broadcast network ABC. The relative results speak for themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 410 - Paley’s QE2 was deceptively simple: focus on industries with attractive economic characteristics, selectively use leverage to buy occasional large properties, improve operations, pay down debt, and repeat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 417 - In a typical roll-up, a company acquires a series of businesses, attempts to improve operations, and then keeps acquiring, benefiting over time from scale advantages and best management practices.</p>
</li>
