<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 266 - They have come down with the disease of “excusitis,” which is invariable fatal to success. They all have good intentions, but as everyone knows, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 271 - Losers make excuses; winners make progress. Now, how can you tell if your favorite excuse is valid or not? It’s simple. Look around and ask, “Is there anyone else who has my same excuse who is successful anyway?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 303 - Perhaps the most important insight of all with regard to success is that to achieve greatly, you must become a different person. It is not the material things you accomplish or acquire that matter so much as it is the quality of the person you must become to accomplish well above the average.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 322 - ‘Self-discipline is the ability to do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not.’”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 333 - The Path of Least Resistance is what causes people to take the easy way in almost every situation. They seek shortcuts to everything. They arrive at work at the last minute and leave at the first opportunity. They look for get-rich-quick schemes and easy money. Over time, they develop the habit of always seeking an easier, faster way to get the things they want rather than doing what is hard but necessary to achieve real success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 368 - Longfellow once wrote: “Those heights by great men, won and kept, Were not achieved by sudden flight. But they, while their companions slept, Were toiling upward in the night.” Your ability to think, plan, and work hard in the short term and to discipline yourself to do what is right and necessary before you do what is fun and easy is the key to creating a wonderful future for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 369 - “Those heights by great men, won and kept, Were not achieved by sudden flight. But they, while their companions slept, Were toiling upward in the night.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 377 - “Law of Unintended Consequences.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 379 - “Law of Perverse Consequences,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 379 - “Law of Perverse Consequences,” which says that “a short-term action aimed at immediate gratification can lead to perverse, or the opposite, consequences from those at which it was aimed.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 386 - “successful people make a habit of doing the things that unsuccessful people don’t like to do.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 390 - What Grey found was that successful people are more concerned with “pleasing results,” whereas failures were more concerned about “pleasing methods.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 416 - The best news is that all habits are learnable. You can learn any habit you need to learn in order to become the kind of person that you want to become. You can become an excellent person by practicing self-discipline whenever it is called for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 424 - The payoff for developing high levels of self-discipline is extraordinary! There is a direct relationship between self-discipline and self-esteem: • The more you practice self-mastery and self-control, the more you like and value yourself; • The more you discipline yourself, the greater is your sense of self-respect and personal pride; • The more you practice self-discipline, the better is your self-image. You see yourself and think about yourself in a more positive way. You feel happier and more powerful as a person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 461 - Your success in life depends more on the person you become than on the things you do or acquire. As Aristotle wrote, “The ultimate end of life is the development of character.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 467 - “The first and best victory is to conquer self.” —PLATO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 471 - “How shall we live in order to be happy?” Your ability to ask and answer that question correctly for yourself—and then to follow where your answer leads you—will largely determine whether you achieve your own happiness, and how soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 489 - A popular definition of success is “being able to live your life in your own way, doing only those things that you want to do, with the people who you choose, in the situations you desire.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 493 - It’s not that you don’t know what to do, but rather that you don’t have the discipline to make yourself do what you should do, whether you feel like it or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 495 - My Note: True lock a deadlock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 497 - “Pareto Principle” has been proven over and over again since it was first formulated in 1895 by Vilfredo Pareto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 503 - learn their jobs in the first year of their employment, and then they never get any better. It is only the top people in every field who are committed to continuous improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 516 - Fully 85 percent of this new generation of millionaires replied by saying something like “I didn’t have a better education or more intelligence, but I was willing to work harder than anyone else.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 531 - This law says that if you want to achieve success in any area, you must determine how success is achieved in that area and then practice those skills and activities repeatedly until you achieve the same results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 533 - “If you do what other successful people do, over and over again, nothing can stop you from eventually enjoying the same rewards that they do. But if you don’t do what successful people do, nothing can help you.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 547 - When you are not working deliberately, consciously, and continuously to do, be, and have those things that constitute success for you, your default mechanism is at work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 552 - “There are only three requirements for success. First, decide exactly what it is you want in life. Second, determine the price that you are going to have to pay to get the things you want. And third, and this is most important, resolve to pay that price.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 567 - Zig Ziglar says, “The elevator to success is out of order, but the stairs are always open.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 570 - self-discipline, is that you must “learn from the experts. You will never live long enough to learn it all for yourself.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 586 - The point of this story is that, by continually seeking out ideas and advice from other experts in his field, he came across a new technology that helped him become the leader in his field and saved him ten years of hard work in order to reach the same level of financial success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 612 - Becoming an expert in your field, continually upgrading your skills—which I will talk about in Chapter 5—is like physical fitness. If you stop exercising for any period of time, you don’t maintain your fitness at the same level. You begin to decline. Your body and your muscles become softer and weaker. You lose your strength, flexibility, and stamina. In order to maintain them, you must keep working at them every day, every week, and every month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 620 - Imagine yourself in a chemistry lab. You mix a series of chemicals in a Petri dish and put it over a Bunsen burner. The Bunsen burner heats the chemicals to the point at which they crystallize and become hardened. But once you have crystallized these chemicals using intense heat, they cannot be transformed back into liquid form. In the same way, your personality begins like a liquid: soft, fluid, and formless. But as you apply the heat of self-discipline, as you exert yourself to do what is hard and necessary rather than what is fun and easy, your personality crystallizes and hardens at a higher level as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 628 - The rule is that “to become someone that you have never been before, you must do something that you have never done before.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 656 - “Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anyone else expects of you. Never excuse yourself. Never pity yourself. Be a hard master to yourself and be lenient to everyone else.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 660 - “What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear a word that you say.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 669 - It is your level of integrity, living in complete truth with yourself and others, that demonstrates more than anything else the quality of your character. In a way, integrity is actually the value that guarantees all the other values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 681 - Emerson also said, “Guard your integrity as a sacred thing; nothing at last is sacred except the integrity of your own mind.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 717 - Study the Values You Admire. You learn values by studying them closely. The Law of Concentration says that “whatever you dwell upon grows and increases in your life.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 727 - Emulate the People You Most Admire. Much of your character is determined by the people you most admire, both living and dead. Who are they? Looking over your life and history, make a list of the people whom you most admire, and next to their names, write out the virtues or values that they most represent to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 735 - Roman Stoic philosopher Epictetus said, “Circumstances do not make the man; they merely reveal him to himself.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 745 - In other words, your self-ideal is composed of those values that you most admire in others and most aspire to possess in yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 750 - On the other hand, weak and irresolute people are fuzzy and unclear about their values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 781 - When you see yourself as calm, positive, truthful, and possessed of high character, you behave with greater strength and personal power. Other people respect you more. You feel in control of yourself and the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 790 - Your self-esteem is defined as “how much you like yourself,” but it’s more than only this. The more you see yourself as a valuable and important person, the more positive and optimistic you will be. When you truly consider yourself to be important and worthwhile, you will treat other people as if they are important as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 799 - Your role models have a tremendous impact on shaping your character. The more you admire a person and his or her qualities, the more you strive—both consciously and unconsciously—to become like that person. This is why clarity is so important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 802 - Whenever you act in a way that is consistent with your values, you feel good about yourself. Whenever you compromise your values, for any reason, you feel bad about yourself. This also means that when you compromise your values, your self-confidence and self-esteem go down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 816 - Universal Maxim of Immanuel Kant: “Resolve to behave as though your every act were to become a universal law for all people.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 817 - One of the great questions for the development of character is this: “What kind of a world would this world be if everyone in it was just like me?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 824 - There is an old Indian story: “On my shoulders are two wolves. One is a black wolf, evil, who continually tempts me to do and say the wrong things. On my other shoulder is a white wolf that continually encourages me to live up to my very best.” A listener asked the old man, “Which of these wolves has the greatest power over you?” The old man replied, “The one I feed.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 852 - The failure to accept responsibility and the attempt to foist responsibility for things in your life that make you unhappy onto other people, institutions, and situations completely distort cause and effect, undermine your character, weaken your resolve, and diminish your humanity. They lead to making endless excuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 879 - Over time, I learned that fully 80 percent of the population never accepts complete responsibility for their lives. They continually complain, criticize, make excuses, and blame other people for things in their lives about which they are not happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 888 - As you grow up, however, you begin to make more and more of your own decisions in each of these areas. But because of your early programming, you are conditioned unconsciously to feel that someone else is still responsible for your life, that there is still someone else out there who can or should take care of you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 922 - The common denominator of all people is the desire to be happy. In its simplest terms, happiness arises from the absence of negative emotions. Where there are no negative emotions, all that is left is positive emotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 926 - Anger is directed inwardly when you bottle it up rather than expressing it constructively to others. Anger is directed outwardly when you criticize or attack other people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 932 - Here is the great discovery: All negative emotions, especially anger, depend for their very existence on your ability to blame someone or something else for something in your life that you are not happy about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 936 - It takes tremendous self-discipline for you to accept complete responsibility for everything you are, everything you become, and everything that happens to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 949 - The fastest and most dependable way to eliminate negative emotions is to immediately say, “I am responsible!” Whenever something happens that triggers anger or a negative reaction of any kind, quickly neutralize the feelings of negativity by saying, “I am responsible.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 979 - Your intelligence is like a double-edged sword: It can cut in either direction. You can use your intelligence to rationalize, justify, and blame other people for things you are not happy about, or you can use your intelligence to find reasons why you are responsible for what happened and then take action to solve the problem or resolve the situation. You can make excuses or you can make progress. You choose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1002 - The only real antidote for anger or worry is purposeful action in the direction of your goals—which is the subject of the next chapter. Before you turn to that, however, resolve today to first take complete control of your thoughts, feeling, and actions, and then to get so busy working on things that are important to you that you don’t have time to think about or express negative emotions to or about anyone, for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1032 - It seems that only 3 percent of adults have written goals and plans, and this 3 percent earn more than all of the other 97 percent put together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1039 - Goals that are not written down and developed into plans are like bullets without powder in the cartridge. People with unwritten goals go through life shooting blanks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1056 - Writing is called a “psycho-neuro-motor activity.” The act of writing forces you to think and concentrate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1066 - functions automatically, your success mechanism is triggered by a goal. When you decide on a goal, you override your failure mechanism, and can you change the direction of your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1077 - Aristotle wrote that human beings are teleological organisms, which simply means that we are purpose driven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1079 - This also means that this ability to become a lifelong goal setter is one of the most important disciplines you will ever develop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1088 - In contrast, when human beings program a goal into their minds, they can then set out without having any idea where they will go or how they will achieve that goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1091 - Still, many people are hesitant to set goals. They say, “I want to be financially independent, but I have no idea how I’m going to get there.” As a result, they don’t even set financial success as a goal. But the good news is that you don’t need to know how to get there. You just need to be clear about what you want to accomplish, and the goal-striving mechanism in your brain will guide you unerringly to your destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1097 - After a series of interviews, you will often walk into the right place at the right time and find yourself in exactly the right job. Almost everyone has had this experience at one time or another. You can have it by design rather than by chance simply by developing absolute clarity about what you really want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1104 - Step 1: Decide Exactly What You Want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1106 - Step 2: Write It Down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1108 - Step 3: Set a Deadline for Your Goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1113 - The rule is “There are no unrealistic goals; there are only unrealistic deadlines.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1118 - Step 4: Make a List of Everything You Can Think of That You Could Possibly Do to Achieve Your Goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1118 - Step 4: Make a List of Everything You Can Think of That You Could Possibly Do to Achieve Your Goal. As Henry Ford said, “The biggest goal can be accomplished if you just break it down into enough small steps.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1121 - list of the obstacles and difficulties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1122 - list of the additional knowledge and skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1124 - list of the people whose cooperation and support you will require to achieve your goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1125 - list of everything that you can think of that you will have to do, and then add to this list as new tasks and responsibilities occur to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1127 - Organize Your List by Both Sequence and Priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1134 - Take Action on Your Plan Immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1140 - Step 7: Do Something Every Day That Moves You in the Direction of Your Major Goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1142 - When you do something every day that moves you in the direction of your goal, you develop momentum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1171 - Once you have decided that this one goal can have the greatest positive impact on your life and you have set it as your major definite purpose, resolve that you will work toward this goal as hard as you can, as long as you can, and that you will never give up until it is achieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1188 - The most important application of the law of cause and effect is that “thoughts are causes, and conditions are effects.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1215 - “We are what we repeatedly do; excellence then is not an act but a habit.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1223 - Your ability to work is your primary source of cash throughout your life. You could lose your home, your car, your bank account, and everything you own, but as long as you have your earning ability, you can earn it all back—and more—in the months and years ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1228 - Your earning ability is very much like a muscle. It can increase in strength and power year by year as the result of regular exercise. Likewise, the opposite is true, too: If left alone or ignored, your earning ability, like your muscles, can become weaker or even decline because you have simply failed to upgrade it continually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1242 - Some people are actually losing value each year, declining in earning ability, because they are not continually upgrading their knowledge and skills. They don’t realize that whatever knowledge and skill they have today is rapidly becoming obsolete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1256 - The average income increase in America is about 3 percent a year, just about the same as the rate of inflation and cost of living increases. People whose income is increasing at 3 percent a year seldom get ahead. They have a job, which can also be thought of as an acronym for “Just Over Broke.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1266 - Knowledge and skill are the keys to the twenty-first century. Becoming the best person you can possibly be and moving to the top of your field require the application of self-discipline throughout your life.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 1291 - Many people say that they would like to be happy, healthy, thin, and rich. But (as discussed in Chapter 4), wishing and hoping are not enough. You have to make a firm, unequivocal decision that you are going to pay any price and go any distance in order to achieve the goals you have set for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1296 - Follow the Leaders, Not the Followers When you decide to be one of the best people in your field, look around you and identify the people who are already at the top:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1338 - Bob did something that few people ever do: When he received advice, he followed it. He immediately took action on the advice and then reported back to the people who had given it to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1359 - The secret to high income in business and sales is quite simple: learn and do. Like jacking up a car, you improve one notch at a time. Each time you learn and practice a new skill, you ratchet up your earning ability—and it locks in. As long as you keep increasing your earning ability, you keep ratcheting up to a higher level, from which you seldom decline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1363 - To guarantee your lifelong success, make a decision today to invest 3 percent of your income back into yourself. This seems to be the magic number for lifelong learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1387 - asked him, “How has investing 10 percent of your income back into yourself affected your income?” He smiled and said, “I passed a million dollars in personal income last year. And I still invest 10 percent of my income in myself every single year.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1397 - Read sixty minutes in your field each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1399 - Listen to educational audio programs in your car.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1401 - Attend courses and seminars in your field regularly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1409 - How long does it take to achieve mastery in your field? According to the experts, the acquisition of “mastery” requires about seven years, or 10,000 hours of hard work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1424 - The fact is that “if you’re not getting better, you’re getting worse.” No one stays in the same place for long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1457 - There is a simple seven-step formula you can use in order to increase your productivity, performance, output, and income by 1,000 percent over the next ten years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1475 - By working on yourself a little bit each day—learning new skills, getting better at your key tasks, setting priorities, and focusing on higher-value activities—you can become 26 percent more productive over the course of an entire year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1481 - If you continued to improve at 26 percent per year, by the end of ten years, with compounding, you would be 1,004 percent more productive. Your income would increase at the same rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1485 - Invest the first hour in yourself by reading something educational, motivational, or spiritual. As Henry Ward Beecher once said, “The first hour is the rudder of the day.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1497 - Rewrite Your Goals, Every Day. Get a spiral notebook and rewrite your major goals in the present tense every morning before you start out, without looking back at what you wrote the previous day. This writing and rewriting is the process of programming instructions into the guidance mechanism of your mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1504 - Plan Every Day in Advance. Make a list, and set priorities on your work before you start off. Your ability to set priorities and to choose the most important thing that you can be doing at every moment is the key to organizing your life and doubling your productivity. (We will talk in detail about time management techniques in Chapter 12.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1509 - Discipline Yourself to Concentrate Single-Mindedly on One Thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1518 - Ask Two Magic Questions After Every Call or Event. First, ask yourself, “What did I do right?” Then, ask yourself, “What would I do differently?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1527 - Treat Every Person You Meet Like a Million-Dollar Customer. Treat each person you meet and work with, both at home and in the office, as though he or she is the most important person in the world. When you treat people as if they are valuable and important, they will return the favor by treating you as if you are valuable and important as well. They will want to be associated with you, work for you, buy from you, and introduce you to their friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1539 - Lifelong personal development and the commitment to personal excellence require tremendous dedication, discipline, and willpower. The greatest payoff is that every time you learn and apply something new, your brain releases endorphins, which make you feel happier and more excited about your future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1561 - “Courage is not absence of fear; it is control of fear, mastery of fear.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1564 - Churchill said, “Courage is rightly considered the foremost of the virtues, for upon it, all others depend.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1567 - So if everyone is afraid, what is the difference between the brave person and the coward? The only difference is that the brave person disciplines himself to confront, deal with, and act in spite of the fear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1570 - situation—“The difference between the hero and the coward is that the hero sticks in there five minutes longer.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1580 - The most common reaction in a fear situation is the attitude of, “I can’t!” This is the fear of failure and loss that stops us from taking action. It is experienced physically, starting in the solar plexus. When people are really afraid, their mouth and throat go dry, their heart starts pounding. Sometimes they breathe shallowly and their stomach churns. Often they feel like getting up and running to the bathroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1588 - Aristotle described courage as the “Golden Mean” between the extremes of cowardice and impetuousness. He taught that “to develop a quality that you lack, act as if you already had that quality in every situation where it is called for.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1588 - Aristotle described courage as the “Golden Mean” between the extremes of cowardice and impetuousness. He taught that “to develop a quality that you lack, act as if you already had that quality in every situation where it is called for.” In modern terms, however, we say, “Fake it until you make it.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1591 - You can actually change your behavior by affirming, visualizing, and acting as if you already have the quality you desire. By affirming, by repeating the words, “I can do it!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1600 - By using the “act as if” method, you walk, talk, and carry yourself exactly as you would if you were completely unafraid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1601 - You stand up straight, smile, move quickly and confidently, and in every respect act as if you already had the courage that you desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1602 - The Law of Reversibility says that “if you feel a certain way, you will act in a manner consistent with that feeling.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1609 - “100-Call Method.” In practicing this method, I instruct the salesperson to go out and call on one hundred prospects as fast as he can, without caring at all whether or not he makes a sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1613 - One sales organization I work with has a daily prize for the first salesperson who gets rejected ten times each morning. At 8:30 A.M., all the salespeople sit down at their desks and start making calls to try to win the prize. By the time the contest is over, usually by 10 A.M., everyone’s fears of rejection have been blown out of their systems. They’re ready to call on prospects all day long, not caring at all about the reactions they get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1620 - According to The Book of Lists, 54 percent of adults rate the fear of public speaking ahead of the fear of death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1621 - They created a system based on what psychologists call “systematic desensitization.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1631 - Psychologists have found that certain fears are bundled together in the subconscious mind, like wires on the same circuit. If you can overcome your fears in one of these areas, you will also eliminate other fears on the same circuit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1633 - The fear of rejection, or call reluctance, seems to be bundled together with the fear of public speaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1654 - Eleanor Roosevelt said, “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1658 - In contrast, when you back away from a fear-inducing situation or person, your fear grows larger and larger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1661 - In leadership, the most common quality is that of vision. Leaders have a clear vision of where they want to take their organizations. Leaders also have a clear vision of where they want to be sometime in the future in their personal lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1661 - In leadership, the most common quality is that of vision. Leaders have a clear vision of where they want to take their organizations. Leaders also have a clear vision of where they want to be sometime in the future in their personal lives. The second most common quality of leaders is that of courage. Leaders have the courage to do whatever is necessary to fulfill their vision. They lead from the front and dare to go forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1666 - First, you need the courage to launch, to take action, to take a leap of faith. You need the courage to go “all in” without any guarantee of success and with a high possibility of failure, at least in the short term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1669 - The second type of courage that you need is called “courageous patience.” This is the ability to hang in there and continue working and fighting after you have gone all in and before you have yet seen any results or rewards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1677 - As Shakespeare said, “Take arms against a sea of troubles, and in so doing, end them.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1679 - Mark Twain once wrote, “I have worried about a lot of things in life, and most of them never happened.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1680 - It has been estimated that 99 percent of the things that you worry about never happen. And most of the things that do happen, happen so quickly that you didn’t have time to worry about them in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1683 - Whenever you are worried about something, fill out a “Disaster Report”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1685 - First, Define the Worry Situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1687 - Second, Identify the Worst Possible Thing That Could Possibly Happen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1691 - Third, Resolve to Accept the Worst Possible Outcome,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1694 - Fourth, Begin Immediately to Improve on the Worst.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1698 - the final analysis, the only real cure for fear or worry is disciplined, purposeful action in the direction of your goals. Get so busy working on your goals or the solutions to your problems that you have no time to be afraid or to worry about anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1717 - “Beware of endeavoring to become a great man in a hurry. One such attempt in 10,000 may succeed. These are fearful odds.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1717 - “Beware of endeavoring to become a great man in a hurry. One such attempt in 10,000 may succeed. These are fearful odds.” —BENJAMIN DISRAELI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1730 - Persistence is its own reward. Every time you force yourself to persist on a task, whether it is large or small, you feel happier and better about yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1737 - Before you can achieve anything worthwhile in life, you have to pass “the persistence test.” This is usually a “snap quiz” sprung on you unexpectedly with no warning. You suddenly face a major setback, problem, temporary failure, or even a complete disaster. When this happens, remind yourself that this is the “testing time.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1741 - Your ability to respond effectively to setbacks—your level of “response-ability”—is the measure of your readiness to succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1751 - The most important quality you need for success and persistence is optimism. This is a boundless confidence in yourself and your ability to ultimately succeed. To remain optimistic, you must control and discipline your thinking when things go wrong. Refuse to feel sorry for yourself. Remember, you are not a victim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1760 - Be Proactive Versus Reactive Resolve to focus on the solution and what can be done now, rather than on what happened and who’s to blame. Think in terms of the actions you can take to resolve the situation rather than what went wrong and who is to blame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1770 - Normal Vincent Peale used to say, “When God wants to send you a gift, he wraps it up in a problem. The bigger the gift that God wants to send you, the bigger the problem he wraps it up in.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1773 - with a problem can be the key to your long-term success. As Napoleon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1774 - Napoleon Hill wrote, “Within every problem or obstacle lays the seed of an equal or greater opportunity or benefit. Your job is to find it.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1776 - “There he stands, like an iron peg, driven into the frozen ground, immovable.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1811 - “Leaders aren’t born; they are made. And they are made just like anything else, through hard work. And that’s the price we’ll have to pay to achieve that goal, or any goal.” —VINCE LOMBARDI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1863 - First, make a list of all the things that you do in a week or a month, from the time you start work on Monday morning through to the end of the week. Write everything down, both small and large, including checking your e-mail and returning phone calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1876 - We call this the “Law of Three.” The Law of Three says that there are three primary things you do that contribute 90 percent or more of your value to your company or organization. Your job is to identify those three critical tasks and then discipline yourself to do them all day long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1883 - First, determine the amount that you earn each hour. You do this by dividing your annual income by the number 2,000 (which is the roughly the number of hours that an entrepreneur or executive works each year in our society: 40 hours a week × 50 weeks a year).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1887 - Whatever it is, from that moment onward, resolve to do only those things that pay you your hourly rate or better. Refuse to do those things that someone else can do at a lower hourly rate than you. Do not waste your time doing things of low value or no value while your other important tasks are building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1895 - “The very worst use of time is to do very well what need not be done at all.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1905 - The key to doubling your productivity and output—and eventually your income—is to really work all the time you are at work. Simply put, when you work, work. Don’t waste time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1909 - The biggest time wasters in the world of work are other people who want to talk with you, distract you, delay you, and take up the time that you should be spending on high-value tasks. When a time waster approaches you and says, “Do you have a minute to talk?” you reply by saying, “Yes, but not now. Why don’t we talk at lunchtime, or after work? In the meantime, I have to get this job finished. I have to get back to work.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1928 - When you are surrounded by time-wasting people and situations, it takes tremendous self-discipline to work all the time you are at work. You must constantly fight against distractions and interruptions so you can get back to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1939 - When I was caught up with my work, instead of relaxing, I would go to my boss and say, “I’m all caught up. I want more work to do. I want more responsibility.” These words became my mantra: “I want more responsibility.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1963 - This is why whenever people ask me how to succeed in business by really trying, I give them the same advice: Whatever your boss gives you to do, do it quickly and well. Then, go and ask for more responsibility. And when you get it, do the job quickly and well until you get a reputation for being the person who does things fast. This will help you advance in your career more than any other reputation you could develop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1968 - Come in a little earlier, work a little harder, and stay a little later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1987 - It is when you put in more than forty hours that you give yourself an advantage over most of the other people in your company—and your business. Make it a habit to do more than what you are paid for. Discipline yourself to put in more than you take out. Every hour that you work over forty hours a week is an investment in your future success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1999 - Each morning before you go to work, look in the mirror and ask yourself, “Do I look like one of the top people in my field?” If you don’t, go back and change—and keep changing until you look like one of the top people in your business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2004 - Make sure that first impression—and then the second and third impressions—are consistent with the message you want to send.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2024 - “Nothing is more harmful to the service than the neglect of discipline; for it is discipline more than numbers that gives one army superiority over another.” —GEORGE WASHINGTON</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2027 - Leadership and self-discipline go hand in hand. It is not possible to imagine an effective leader who lacks self-discipline, willpower, self-control, and self-mastery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2027 - Leadership and self-discipline go hand in hand. It is not possible to imagine an effective leader who lacks self-discipline, willpower, self-control, and self-mastery. The overarching characteristic of a leader is that he is in complete control of himself and of every situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2042 - As you move up the scale of management, becoming more knowledgeable and effective and getting more and better results from more and different people, you reach the highest level, that of a leader. At this stage, you are responsible for determining what is to be done rather than how it is to be done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2053 - The first quality of leadership, based on 3,300 studies of leaders done by James MacPherson, is the quality of vision .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2056 - You become a leader when you accept responsibility for results. You become a leader when you begin to think, act, and talk like a leader. You become a leader when you develop a vision for yourself and for your company, your life, or your area of responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2066 - You cannot raise morale in a business; it filters down from the top, from the leader. The behavior of the leader influences and affects the behavior of everyone else. If the leader is positive, confident, and upbeat, everyone in the organization will be influenced by this behavior and will be more positive, confident, and upbeat as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2080 - The leader sets the standards for the organization’s behavior, quality of work, personal organization, time management, and appearance. In excellent organizations, the leader is the person who everyone looks up to and wants to emulate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2082 - In most cases, the leader works harder than others in the company. The leader appears to be more committed, determined, courageous, visionary, and persistent than anyone else. The leader sets a tone that everyone wants to emulate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2087 - In addition to a clear vision for the organization, the leader must have a set of values and organizing principles that guide behavior and decision making. Everyone must know what the leader and the company stand for and believe in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2100 - You must be absolutely clear about the goals and objectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2108 - This passionate commitment to the organization—and to success and achievement—motivates and inspires people to do their best work and put their whole hearts into their jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2113 - The leader is continually encouraging people to find faster, better, cheaper, and easier ways to produce excellent products and services and to take better care of customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2115 - The leader is personally committed to reading, listening, and upgrading his or her personal knowledge and skills as an executive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2121 - The leader has the self-discipline to be consistent, dependable, reliable, calm, and predictable in all situations. One of the great comforts of business life is for an employee to know that the leader is completely consistent and reliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2123 - The leader is not “blown in the wind” by each new situation, problem, or emergency that arises. Instead, the leader is calm, positive, and confident—especially under pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2125 - The only thing that is inevitable in the life of the leader is the crisis. When you rise to a position of leadership, you will experience crises repeatedly—crises that are unpredictable, unbidden, and often capable of seriously damaging the organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2130 - Great leaders discipline themselves to keep their fears and misgivings private. They do not share their concerns with their staffs, knowing that this can cause confusion and loss of morale. Instead, the leader asks a lot of questions, probes deeply into situations so that he or she understands them thoroughly, and keeps his or her feelings private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2136 - There is a direct relationship between your ability to discipline yourself and your behaviors and your readiness to lead. It is only when you prove to others that you are in complete control of yourself that they develop the confidence to put you in a leadership position—and keep you there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2142 - Leaders discipline themselves to plan, prepare, organize, and check every detail. They take nothing for granted. They ask questions to ensure that they have a complete understanding of a situation, problem, or difficulty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2146 - Leaders are intensely action-oriented. They gather information carefully and make the decisions that are necessary. They set measures and standards and hold others to them. They insist that the job be done quickly and well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2176 - There is no area of activity that demands more self-discipline than starting and operating a successful business in our current economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2177 - The first law of economics is scarcity. As a rule, there is never enough of anything for everyone who wants it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2182 - If the first law of economics is scarcity, then the first law of business is competition. It requires tremendous focus and discipline to do the things necessary to attract the scarce money of customers toward purchasing your product or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2188 - You must be completely honest with your product/ service mix to ensure that it is well suited to the current market. This is an area where false assumptions or incorrect conclusions can lead to business failure. This answer is continually changing as competition and customer tastes also change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2196 - When you are a new business - person or starting a new business, you will be wrong even more often than this. It is not unusual for an entrepreneur to be wrong 90 percent of the time in the beginning of his career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2207 - Because of the aggressive and determined nature of your competition, in order to simply survive, you must discipline yourself to be equal to or better than your competitors. After all, your competitors get out of bed every morning thinking about how they can put you out of business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2216 - Most business ideas do not work, at least in their original form. As Peter Drucker said, “Errant assumptions lie at the root of every failure.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2224 - The reason why so many entrepreneurs underachieve and fail is that they lack discipline. They lack the discipline to carefully study every aspect of the business before committing to it. They lack the discipline to test their assumptions rather than jumping to conclusions and hoping for the best. Don’t let this happen to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2231 - To market effectively, you must be clear about your competitive advantage and your unique selling proposition:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2234 - You need the discipline to develop a complete sales system, from beginning to end, that converts qualified leads into solid customers. It is amazing how many businesses just assume that the product or service will sell itself—whether they have a superior sales system or not!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2246 - What is the purpose of a business? The purpose of a business is to create and keep a customer in a cost-effective manner. Profits are not the purpose of a business. Profits are the result of creating and keeping a sufficient number of customers who yield a sufficient number of profits after all costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2255 - What is the key to long-term profitability? The answer is recommendations and referrals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2258 - You can survive and thrive only when the majority of your customers are so happy with your products and services that they will encourage their friends and associates to buy from you as well. Since a referral from a satisfied customer is fifteen times easier to sell to than a cold call (which means it costs only one fifteenth as much), referral business is the key to your future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2264 - You need to practice the CANEI Formula, which stands for, “Continuous and Never-Ending Improvement.” No matter how high your level of quality is today, you can never be satisfied. You must continually be raising the bar on yourself—and on everyone within your area of responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2271 - To succeed in business, you need the self-discipline to be proactive rather than reactive. You need to focus on solutions rather than problems. You need to concentrate on the most important thing you could possibly be doing every hour of every day rather than getting sidetracked by low-value or no-value tasks and activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2324 - The remaining time was spent on meetings, discussions, paperwork, administrative work, luncheons, and a variety of other activities that contributed nothing to sales generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2327 - You must spend 75 percent of your time working with your salespeople and accompanying them when they visit your customers to make presentations and sales. Do your paperwork before or after work, but during working hours, when customers are available to be seen, you should dedicate yourself entirely to sales generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2337 - One of the most important questions you can ask as a salesperson, entrepreneur, or business owner is whether what you’re doing right now is leading to a sale. Ask this question of yourself repeatedly throughout the day. Every time the answer comes up “no,” you must immediately stop whatever you are doing of lower value and turn your attention to sales generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2342 - Assuming that you have an attractive product or service, one that is reasonably priced and suited to the current market, the biggest problem that telephone salespeople and outside salespeople face is rejection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2347 - Therefore, to avoid the emotional pain that comes with rejection, many salespeople engage in a series of “displacement” activities to avoid being rejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2353 - When is a salesperson working? The salesperson is working only when he or she is ear to ear (on the phone) or face to face with someone who can and will buy within a reasonable period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2366 - Winston Churchill said, “Success is the ability to go from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2381 - You can seldom tell where your next sale is going to come from. Therefore, you have to “cast a wide net” and speak to as many prospective customers as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2409 - Discipline yourself to cluster your calls in a small geo - graphical area so that you can get face to face with more people in a shorter amount of time. Many salespeople, because of their fear of rejection, spread their calls out over a large geographical area and then convince themselves that they are actually working when they are really simply driving from call to call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2451 - “In reading the lives of great men, I found that the first victory they won was over themselves; self discipline with all of them came first.” —HARRY S. TRUMAN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2496 - The starting point of achieving financial independence is to discipline yourself to rewire your attitude toward money. You need to reach into your subconscious mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2496 - The starting point of achieving financial independence is to discipline yourself to rewire your attitude toward money. You need to reach into your subconscious mind and disconnect the wire linking “spending” and “happiness.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2511 - Because the money in your account is emotionalized by your own thoughts and feelings, it sets up a force field of energy that begins to attract more money into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2514 - The Law of Accumulation says that “every great achievement is an accumulation of many small achievements.” The Law of Attraction says that “you attract into your life those things that are in harmony with your dominant thoughts.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2526 - Today, however, financial advisers suggest that you need to save 15 or 20 percent of your income in order to achieve all your financial goals. Any less than this opens you up to the risk of running out of money later in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2545 - The reward for saving and investing is substantial. It is said that “happiness is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2566 - “Everyone here has already increased their income dramatically, but it has done no good. Simply increasing your income does not ensure that you will achieve financial independence. This is because of Parkinson’s Law, which says, ‘Expenditures rise to meet income.’ No matter how much you earn, you end up spending it all, and more besides.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2583 - This means that if you are serious about achieving financial independence, the most important single requirement is self-discipline combined with the ability to delay gratification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2611 - The fact is that you cannot save time; you can only spend it differently. You can only reallocate your time usage from areas of low value to areas of high value. Herein lies the key to success, and the requirement for self-discipline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2621 - Some things you do are five times and even ten times more valuable than other things, even though they take the same number of minutes and hours. The most important things you do—the top 20 percent—are usually big, difficult, and daunting. In contrast, the 80 percent of things that you do that make little or no difference to your life are usually fun, easy, and enjoyable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2630 - The essence of time management is for you to discipline yourself to set clear priorities—and then stick to those priorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2637 - Companies invest financial capital, but individuals invest “human capital.” Companies deploy financial assets, but your most vital assets are your mental, emotional, and physical energies. How you invest them determines your entire quality of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2644 - Before you commit to any time-consuming activity, you must always ask, “Is this the very best use of my time?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2650 - Setting priorities requires setting posteriorities as well. A priority is something that you do more of and sooner, whereas a posteriority is something you do less of or later. You are probably already overwhelmed with too much to do and too little time. Because of this, for you to embark on a new task, you must discontinue an old task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2661 - For example, completing a course of study at the university can have enormous consequences that can impact your life for the next fifty years. Completing a major task or project at work or making an important sale can have significant consequences for your job and your income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2673 - Then apply the A B C D E Method to your list: • A = “Must do”—Serious consequences for noncompletion; • B = “Should do”—Mild consequences for doing or not doing; • C = “Nice to do”—No consequences whether you do it or not; • D = “Delegate”—Everything you possibly can to free up more time for those things that only you can do; • E = “Eliminate”—Discontinue all tasks and activities that are no longer essential to your work and to achieving your goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2688 - It takes tremendous self-discipline to select your most important task and then to start on that task rather than doing anything else. But once you begin to work on it, you will start to feel a flow of energy that motivates and propels you into the task. You will feel more positive and confident. You will feel happier and more determined. The very act of starting on an important task raises your self-esteem and motivates you to continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2698 - As you feel yourself moving forward, making progress on your most important task, your brain releases a steady flow of endorphins, nature’s “happy drug.” These endorphins will make you feel more positive, focused, alert, aware, and in control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2707 - The Law of Forced Efficiency says, “There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important things.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2731 - What stands between you and your goals are almost always problems and difficulties of some kind. Your ability to effectively solve the problems of daily life can have an enormous impact on your results and rewards. We will talk about this in the next chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2747 - “Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2769 - When you face an unexpected problem or crisis, discipline yourself to stay calm, to focus on the solution rather than the problem. Think in terms of what can be done now, rather than thinking about how it occurred and who is to blame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2781 - Top people realize that every problem is an opportunity to grow in self-control and personal confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2784 - Some years ago, Dr. Lawrence Peter wrote a book called The Peter Principle. It was an amusing book with a central thesis that cut too close to home. He wrote that in every organization, people continue to be promoted until they reach a level where they are no longer competent to solve the problems at that level. This is where they stop and stay for the rest of their careers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2800 - A Nine-Step Method for Solving Problems Effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2801 - Step 1: Take the Time to Define the Problem Clearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2802 - “accurate diagnosis is half the cure.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2806 - Step 2: Ask, “Is It Really a Problem?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2809 - Also, very often what appears to be a problem or a setback is actually an opportunity in disguise. Sometimes, the problem does not need to be solved at all. Instead, you are now free to do something completely different—which might be even better for you and your organization.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2852 - The flip side of self-esteem is called “self-efficacy.” Your level of self-efficacy is defined as “how competent you feel you are to solve your problems and achieve your goals.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2883 - “No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed. No stream or gas drives anything until it is confined. No Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled. No life ever grows great until it is focused, dedicated, disciplined.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2894 - Law of Control, which states, “You feel happy to the degree to which you feel you are in control of your own life. You feel unhappy to the degree to which you feel you are not in control, or controlled by other factors or people.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2911 - Many people feel that they are controlled by their own personalities and that they are not able to change for the better. They say, “That’s just the way I am.” By saying this, they absolve themselves of all responsibility for exerting the necessary discipline and willpower to make the changes they know they need to make in order to live the kind of life they want to live and to be happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2921 - There is an old saying that “success is getting what you want; happiness is wanting what you get.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2972 - Self-actualization. This is the feeling that you are becoming everything you are capable of becoming. This occurs when you feel that you are realizing more and more of your true potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2984 - The third deficiency need that Maslow identified is belongingness. Each person has a need to be in social relationships with others, both at home and at work. You need to be recognized and accepted by other people in your world. Each person needs to be comfortable in his or her relationships with others and seen and accepted as part of a team or group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3004 - The wonderful thing about self-actualization needs is that they can never be completely satisfied. As you continually strive throughout your life to be and have and do more than ever before, you experience a steady flow of happiness and contentment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3275 - “It is better to control yourself than to win a thousand battles. Then the victory is yours. It cannot be taken from you, not by angels or demons, heaven or hell.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3307 - is said that “everything we do in life is either to get love, or to compensate for a lack of love.” Psychologists generally agree that the root cause of personality problems in adult life can be traced back to “love withheld” in infancy and childhood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3326 - Self-discipline in a relationship requires that you be completely honest and open, that you be yourself and never try to be someone or something else. Self-discipline and honesty require that you state clearly what you are thinking and feeling, without anger or irritation, and that you listen calmly and patiently to the feelings, thoughts, and opinions of the other person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3333 - Men can process only one sensory input at a time, whereas women can process multiple sensory inputs. When a man is watching television, he does not see or hear anything else, including words spoken to him from the side or behind. He becomes totally fixated on the visual images and words on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3338 - Women, on the other hand, can talk, make dinner, watch television, read the day’s mail, and talk to her children or husband all at once. They are multidimensional and can process several inputs simultaneously. They can talk and listen at the same time and be aware of what other people around them are doing and saying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3350 - Perhaps the most important area of mutual compatibility has to do with the discipline of listening. It is only when two people take the time to listen closely and carefully to each other when they speak that the lines of communications stay open, and this is when love and harmony continue in the relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3356 - Listen Attentively. The first discipline is to listen attentively , without interrupting. Listen as though the other person is about to reveal a great secret or the winning lottery number and you will hear it only once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3361 - The book His Needs, Her Needs points out that the most important need that a woman has from a man is affection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3365 - Pause before Replying. The second discipline of listening is to pause before replying. Take a few seconds to carefully consider what he or she has said. When you pause, you avoid the risk of interrupting the other person if she is just reformulating her thoughts. You tell her that you value what she said and that you are giving her words careful consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3371 - Ask for Clarification. The third discipline of effective listening is to question for clarification. Never assume that you automatically know what the other person is thinking or feeling. Instead, if you are at all unclear, simply</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3371 - Ask for Clarification. The third discipline of effective listening is to question for clarification. Never assume that you automatically know what the other person is thinking or feeling. Instead, if you are at all unclear, simply ask, “How do you mean?” or “How do you mean, exactly?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3376 - Feed It Back. The fourth discipline of effective listening is for you to feed back what the other person has said, and paraphrase it in your own words. This is the “acid test” of listening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3393 - First, make a decision, in advance, that you will never, never be unfaithful to your spouse. Like drawing a line in the sand, make the decision in advance that no matter what happens, you will not stray for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3407 - There are only four ways that you can change your life. First, you can do more of some things. Second, you can do less of other things. Third, you can start something that you have never done before. And fourth, you can stop certain things altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3424 - Most of all, a happy, a loving marriage requires that you see your spouse as your best friend. There should be no one in the world who you would rather spend time with more than him or her. There should be no one with whom you are more open and honest than with him or her. When you see your spouse as your best friend and treat him or her as such, you can create a loving relationship that lasts all the days of your lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3528 - philosopher once said, “Before I had children, I had four philosophies about raising children. Now, I have four children, and no philosophies.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3554 - The most important job you have as a parent is to instill values and to build character in your children. You do this by teaching them what values are important, especially those of integrity and truth telling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3637 - “Everything you want in life has a price connected to it. There is a price to pay if you want to make things better, a price to pay for leaving things as they are, a price for everything.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3654 - First, your self-image is made up of the way you see yourself. This largely determines the way you walk, talk, behave, and interact with others. 2. The second part of your self-image is the way you think others see you. If you think other people like, respect, and admire you, you see yourself in a positive way and you enjoy higher feelings of self-esteem and self-importance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3657 - The third part of your self-image is the way people actually do see you and treat you. If you think you are well liked and popular and someone treats you in a rude or disrespectful way, it can be a shock to your self-image and lower your self-esteem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3672 - The secret to building and maintaining wonderful friendships and relationships is simple. It is for you to practice the Law of Indirect Effort in every interaction with other people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3675 - Therefore, if you want to have a friend, you must first be a friend. If you want people to like you, you should first like them. If you want people to respect you, you should first respect them. If you want to impress others, you should first be impressed by them. In this way, by approaching people indirectly, you appeal to their deepest subconscious needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3682 - Whenever you say or do anything to raise the self-esteem of another person, you trigger a “boomerang” effect that causes your own self-esteem to go up at the same time and in the same measure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3688 - The key to excellent relationships with others is quite simple: Make them feel important. To the degree to which you can make other people feel important—starting with the members of your family and then extending outward to your friends and coworkers—you will become one of the most popular people in your world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3714 - The most welcomed people in every situation are those who are generally agreeable and positive with others. On the other hand, argumentative people who question, complain, and disagree are seldom welcome anywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3724 - People usually invest a lot of personal emotion in their possessions, traits, and accomplishments. When you admire something belonging to another person, it makes him feel happy about himself. As Abraham Lincoln said, “Everybody likes a compliment.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3806 - Most people have a deep down need to be right. However, when you stop caring if you are right or wrong, all the emotions surrounding this need for rightness disappear. Dr. Gerald Jampolsky asked the great question: “Do you want to be right, or do you want to be happy?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3815 - The chief cause of negative emotions and the primary destroyer of inner peace is blame. As I mentioned earlier in the book, it is not possible to have a negative emotion without having someone or something to blame in some way or for something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3828 - The second root cause of blaming is justification. This occurs when you tell yourself (and others) why it is that you are entitled to be angry or upset in this situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3839 - The height of self-discipline in spiritual development is the practice of forgiveness. The Law of Forgiveness says that “you are mentally and emotionally healthy to the degree that you can freely forgive anyone who has hurt you in any way.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3844 - The only question you need to ask and answer after you have had a negative experience is “How long will it take me to get over this event and get on with my life?” This is a decision only you can make. It is one of the most important types of decisions that you make in your own life if you truly want to be happy. What’s more, it is a true test of your mental and spiritual discipline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3848 - Each person has a “Forgetting Curve,” or what is often called a “Forgiveness Curve.” This curve measures how quickly you forgive and forget a negative experience, and it determines how mentally and emotionally healthy you really are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3855 - There are countless people who are still angry about something one of their parents did or said to them decades ago. Furthermore, they will tell you about it at the drop of a hat. They will reach into their gunnysack of unforgiven events and pull out their childhood experiences and share them with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3861 - Truly healthy people, on the other hand, have downward sloping forgiveness curves. They have had just as many difficulties and problems in life as anyone else, but they have disciplined themselves by resolving to forgive and forget quickly so they can get on with their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3868 - Some people are confused about the concept of forgiveness. They think that forgiving someone else for having hurt them is the same as condoning that behavior, or even approving of it. Quite the contrary. Forgiveness is a purely selfish act. Forgiveness has nothing whatever to do with the other person. You forgive others so that you yourself can be emotionally free, so that you no longer carry that baggage around with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3877 - The instant you accept responsibility and forgive everyone for anything that they ever did to hurt you in any way, you liberate yourself completely. All your negative emotions disappear. In place of your negative emotions, you experience a sense of inner peace, love, happiness, and joy.</p>
