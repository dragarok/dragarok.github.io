<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 258 - currencies were targeted by worried governments and eventually litigated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 369 - A wallet is simply a collection of addresses and the keys that unlock the funds within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 512 - The inputs and outputs (debits and credits) do not necessarily add up to the same amount. Instead, outputs add up to slightly less than inputs and the difference represents an implied “transaction fee,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 516 - In bitcoin terms, “spending” is signing a transaction that transfers value from a previous transaction over to a new owner identified by a bitcoin address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 519 - Transactions move value from transaction inputs to transaction outputs. An input is where the coin value is coming from, usually a previous transaction’s output. A transaction output assigns a new owner to the value by associating it with a key. The destination key is called an encumbrance. It imposes a requirement for a signature for the funds to be redeemed in future transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 565 - This URL will return all the unspent transaction outputs for an address, giving any application the information it needs to construct transaction inputs for spending. We use the simple command-line HTTP client cURL to retrieve the response. Example 2-1. Look up all the unspent outputs for Alice’s bitcoin address $ curl <a href="https://blockchain.info/unspent?active=1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK">https://blockchain.info/unspent?active=1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 624 - Because the transaction contains all the information necessary to process, it does not matter how or where it is transmitted to the bitcoin network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 630 - Any bitcoin network node (other client) that receives a valid transaction it has not seen before will immediately forward it to other nodes to which it is connected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 654 - A good way to describe mining is like a giant competitive game of sudoku that resets every time someone finds a solution and whose difficulty automatically adjusts so that it takes approximately 10 minutes to find a solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 666 - As more miners started joining the bitcoin network, the difficulty of the problem increased rapidly. Soon, Jing and other miners upgraded to more specialized hardware, such as high-end dedicated graphical processing units (GPUs) cards such as those used in gaming desktops or consoles. At the time of this writing, the difficulty is so high that it is profitable only to mine with application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), essentially hundreds of mining algorithms printed in hardware, running in parallel on a single silicon chip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 869 - The Bitcoin Core client implements a JSON-RPC interface that can also be accessed using the command-line helper bitcoin-cli.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1051 - Transaction IDs are not authoritative until a transaction has been confirmed. Absence of a transaction hash in the blockchain does not mean the transaction was not processed. This is known as “transaction malleability,” because transaction hashes can be modified prior to confirmation in a block. After confirmation, the txid is immutable and authoritative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1359 - The libbitcoin library is a cross-platform C++ development toolkit that supports the libbitcoin-server full node and the Bitcoin Explorer (bx) command line tool. The bx commands offer many of the same capabilities as the bitcoind client commands we illustrated in this chapter. The bx commands also offer some key management and manipulation tools that are not offered by bitcoind, including type-2 deterministic keys and mnemonic key encoding, as well as stealth address, payment, and query support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1371 - Bitcoin Explorer offers many useful commands for encoding and decoding addresses, and converting to and from different formats and representations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1498 - In the payment portion of a bitcoin transaction, the recipient’s public key is represented by its digital fingerprint, called a bitcoin address, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary name on a check (i.e., “Pay to the order of”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1498 - In the payment portion of a bitcoin transaction, the recipient’s public key is represented by its digital fingerprint, called a bitcoin address, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary name on a check (i.e., “Pay to the order of”). In most cases, a bitcoin address is generated from and corresponds to a public key.</p>

In most cases, a bitcoin address is generated from and corresponds to a public key. However, not all bitcoin addresses represent public keys; they can also represent other beneficiaries such as scripts,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1504 - The bitcoin address is the only representation of the keys that users will routinely see, because this is the part they need to share with the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1514 - Bitcoin uses elliptic curve multiplication as the basis for its public key cryptography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1523 - In most wallet implementations, the private and public keys are stored together as a key pair for convenience. However, the public key can be calculated from the private key, so storing only the private key is also possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1528 - The private key (k) is a number, usually picked at random. From the private key, we use elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic function, to generate a public key (K). From the public key (K), we use a one-way cryptographic hash function to generate a bitcoin address (A).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1541 - You can pick your private keys randomly using just a coin, pencil, and paper: toss a coin 256 times and you have the binary digits of a random private key you can use in a bitcoin wallet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1553 - In programming terms, this is usually achieved by feeding a larger string of random bits, collected from a cryptographically secure source of randomness, into the SHA256 hash algorithm that will conveniently produce a 256-bit number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1585 - The public key is calculated from the private key using elliptic curve multiplication, which is irreversible: where k is the private key, G is a constant point called the generator point and K is the resulting public key. The reverse operation, known as “finding the discrete logarithm” — calculating k if you know K — is as difficult as trying all possible values of k, i.e., a brute-force search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1596 - Bitcoin uses a specific elliptic curve and set of mathematical constants, as defined in a standard called secp256k1, established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1598 - The secp256k1 curve is defined by the following function, which produces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1604 - finite field of prime order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1628 - There is also a + operator, called “addition,” which has some properties similar to the traditional addition of real numbers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1629 - some properties similar to the traditional addition of real numbers that grade school children learn. Given two points P1 and P2 on the elliptic curve, there is a third point P3 = P1 + P2, also on the elliptic curve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1629 - some properties similar to the traditional addition of real numbers that grade school children learn. Given two points P1 and P2 on the elliptic curve, there is a third point P3 = P1 + P2, also on the elliptic curve. Geometrically, this third point P3 is calculated by drawing a line between P1 and P2.</p>

Given two points P1 and P2 on the elliptic curve, there is a third point P3 = P1 + P2, also on the elliptic curve. Geometrically, this third point P3 is calculated by drawing a line between P1 and P2. This line will intersect the elliptic curve in exactly one additional place. Call this point P3&rsquo; = (x, y). Then reflect in the x-axis to get P3 = (x, –y). There</p>

Then reflect in the x-axis to get P3 = (x, –y).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1634 - If P1 and P2 are the same point, the line “between” P1 and P2 should extend to be the tangent on the curve at this point P1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1643 - Now that we have defined addition, we can define multiplication in the standard way that extends addition. For a point P on the elliptic curve, if k is a whole number, then kP = P + P + P + … + P (k times).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1711 - Base58 is Base64 without the 0 (number zero), O (capital o), l (lower L), I (capital i), and the symbols “\+” and “/”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1716 - Base58Check is a Base58 encoding format, frequently used in bitcoin, which has a built-in error-checking code. The checksum is an additional four bytes added to the end of the data that is being encoded. The checksum is derived from the hash of the encoded data and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1716 - The checksum is an additional four bytes added to the end of the data that is being encoded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1718 - When presented with a Base58Check code, the decoding software will calculate the checksum of the data and compare it to the checksum included in the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1721 - To convert data (a number) into a Base58Check format, we first add a prefix to the data, called the “version byte,” which serves to easily identify the type of data that is encoded. For example, in the case of a bitcoin address the prefix is zero (0x00 in hex),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1728 - The result is composed of three items: a prefix, the data, and a checksum. This result is encoded using the Base58 alphabet described previously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1733 - In bitcoin, most of the data presented to the user is Base58Check-encoded to make it compact, easy to read, and easy to detect errors. The version prefix in Base58Check encoding is used to create easily distinguishable formats, which when encoded in Base58 contain specific characters at the beginning of the Base58Check-encoded payload. These characters make it easy for humans to identify the type of data that is</p>

This is what differentiates, for example, a Base58Check-encoded bitcoin address that starts with a 1 from a Base58Check-encoded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1856 - Wallet Import Format (WIF)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1857 - Notice that the “payload” of the compressed key is appended with the suffix 01, signalling that the derived public key is to be compressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1862 - opposite of the previous command), we use the base58check-encode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1894 - if we know the x coordinate we can calculate the y coordinate by solving the equation y2 mod p = (x3 + 7) mod p. That allows us to store only the x coordinate of the public key point,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1907 - to distinguish between the two possible values of y, we store a compressed public key with the prefix 02 if the y is even, and 03 if it is odd, allowing the software to correctly deduce the y coordinate from the x coordinate and uncompress the public key to the full coordinates of the point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1919 - a single private key can produce a public key expressed in two different formats (compressed and uncompressed) that produce two different bitcoin addresses. However, the private key is identical for both bitcoin addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1936 - Private keys are not compressed and cannot be compressed. The term “compressed private key” really means “private key from which compressed public keys should be derived,” whereas “uncompressed private key” really means “private key from which uncompressed public keys should be derived.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2155 - In the first bitcoin clients, wallets were simply collections of randomly generated private keys. This type of wallet is called a Type-0 nondeterministic wallet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2167 - Deterministic, or “seeded” wallets are wallets that contain private keys that are all derived from a common seed, through the use of a one-way hash function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2184 - BIP0039 defines the creation of a mnemonic code and seed as a follows: Create a random sequence (entropy) of 128 to 256 bits. Create a checksum of the random sequence by taking the first few bits of its SHA256 hash. Add the checksum to the end of the random sequence. Divide the sequence into sections of 11 bits, using those to index a dictionary of 2048 predefined words. Produce 12 to 24 words representing the mnemonic code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2231 - Hierarchical deterministic wallets contain keys derived in a tree structure, such that a parent key can derive a sequence of children keys, each of which can derive a sequence of grandchildren keys, and so on, to an infinite depth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2241 - The second advantage of HD wallets is that users can create a sequence of public keys without having access to the corresponding private keys. This allows HD wallets to be used on an insecure server or in a receive-only capacity,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2254 - The root seed is input into the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm and the resulting hash is used to create a master private key (m) and a master chain code. The master private key (m) then generates a corresponding master public key (M), using the normal elliptic curve multiplication process m * G that we saw earlier in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2261 - The child key derivation functions are based on a one-way hash function that combines: A parent private or public key (ECDSA uncompressed key) A seed called a chain code (256 bits) An index number (32 bits) The chain code is used to introduce seemingly random data to the process, so that the index is not sufficient to derive other child keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2274 - Each parent key can have 2 billion children keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2278 - Child private keys are indistinguishable from nondeterministic (random) keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2285 - A child private key, the corresponding public key, and the bitcoin address are all indistinguishable from keys and addresses created randomly. The fact that they are part of a sequence is not visible, outside of the HD wallet function that created them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2290 - The two essential ingredients are the key and chain code, and combined these are called an extended key. The term “extended key” could also be thought of as “extensible key” because such a key can be used to derive children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2290 - The two essential ingredients are the key and chain code, and combined these are called an extended key. The term “extended key” could also be thought of as “extensible key” because such a key can be used to derive children. Extended keys are stored and represented simply as the concatenation of the 256-bit key and 256-bit chain code into a 512-bit sequence. There are two types of extended keys. An extended private key is the combination of a private key and chain code and can be used to derive child private keys (and from them, child public keys).</p>

An extended public key is a public key and chain code, which can be used to create child public keys, as described in Generating a Public Key</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2300 - Sharing an extended key gives access to the entire branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2302 - The Base58Check coding for extended keys uses a special version number that results in the prefix “xprv” and “xpub” when encoded in Base58 characters, to make them easily recognizable. Because the extended key is 512 or 513 bits, it is also much longer than other Base58Check-encoded strings we have seen previously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2313 - An extended public key can be used, therefore, to derive all of the public keys (and only the public keys) in that branch of the HD wallet structure.</p>

This shortcut can be used to create very secure public-key-only deployments where a server or application has a copy of an extended public key and no private keys whatsoever. That kind of deployment can produce an infinite number of public keys and bitcoin addresses, but cannot spend any of the money sent to those addresses.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2334 - A single leaked child private key, together with a parent chain code, reveals all the private keys of all the children. Worse, the child private key together with a parent chain code can be used to deduce the parent private key. To counter this risk, HD wallets use an alternative derivation function called hardened derivation, which “breaks” the relationship between parent public key and child chain code. The hardened derivation function uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key.</p>

<p>loc 3177 - When a chain of transactions is transmitted across the network, they don’t always arrive in the same order. Sometimes, the child might arrive before the parent. In that case, the nodes that see a child first can see that it references a parent transaction that is not yet known. Rather than reject the child, they put it in a temporary pool to await the arrival of its parent and propagate it to every other node. The pool of transactions without parents is known as the orphan transaction pool. Once the parent arrives, any orphans that reference the UTXO created by the parent are released from the pool, revalidated recursively, and then the entire chain of transactions can be included in the transaction pool, ready to be mined in a block.</p>

If the unlocking script executed without errors (e.g., it has no “dangling” operators left over), the main stack (not the alternate stack) is copied and the locking script is executed. If the result of executing the locking script with the stack data copied from the unlocking script is “TRUE,” the unlocking script has succeeded in resolving the conditions imposed by the locking script and, therefore, the input is a valid authorization to spend the UTXO.</p>

It requires minimal processing and cannot do many of the fancy things modern programming languages can do. In the case of programmable money, that is a deliberate security feature. Bitcoin’s scripting language is called a stack-based language because it uses a data structure called a stack. A stack is a very simple data structure, which can be visualized as a stack of cards. A stack allows two operations: push and pop. Push adds an item on top of the stack. Pop removes the top item from the stack. The scripting language executes the script by processing each item from left to right. Numbers (data constants) are pushed onto the stack. Operators push or pop one or more parameters from the stack, act on them, and might push a result onto the stack. For example, OP_ADD will pop two items from the stack, add them, and push the resulting sum onto the stack. Conditional operators evaluate a condition, producing a boolean</p>

<p>loc 3416 - Pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) was developed to resolve these practical difficulties and to make the use of complex scripts as easy as a payment to a bitcoin address. With P2SH payments, the complex locking script is replaced with its digital fingerprint, a cryptographic hash. When a transaction attempting to spend the UTXO is presented later, it must contain the script that matches the hash, in addition to the unlocking script. In simple terms, P2SH means “pay to a script matching this hash, a script that will be presented later when this output is spent.”</p>

<p>loc 3686 - Let’s assume, for example, that a node only has the genesis block. It will then receive an inv message from its peers containing the hashes of the next 500 blocks in the chain. It will start requesting blocks from all of its connected peers, spreading the load and ensuring that it doesn’t overwhelm any peer with requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3703 - SPV nodes download only the block headers and do not download the transactions included in each block. The resulting chain of blocks, without transactions, is 1,000 times smaller than the full blockchain. SPV nodes cannot construct a full picture of all the UTXOs that are available for spending because they do not know about all the transactions on the network. SPV nodes verify transactions using a slightly different methodology that relies on peers to provide partial views of relevant parts of the blockchain on demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3719 - An SPV node cannot validate whether the UTXO is unspent. Instead, the SPV node will establish a link between the transaction and the block that contains it, using a merkle path (see Merkle Trees). Then, the SPV node waits until it sees the six blocks 300,001 through 300,006 piled on top of the block containing the transaction and verifies it by establishing its depth under blocks 300,006 to 300,001. The fact that other nodes on the network accepted block 300,000 and then did the necessary work to produce six more blocks on top of it is proof, by proxy, that the transaction was not a double-spend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3724 - An SPV node cannot be persuaded that a transaction exists in a block when the transaction does not in fact exist. The SPV node establishes the existence of a transaction in a block by requesting a merkle path proof and by validating the proof of work in the chain of blocks. However, a transaction’s existence can be “hidden” from an SPV node.</p>

However, a transaction’s existence can be “hidden” from an SPV node.

<li>
<p>loc 3729 - To defend against this, an SPV node needs to connect randomly to several nodes, to increase the probability that it is in contact with at least one honest node. This need to randomly connect means that SPV nodes also are vulnerable to network partitioning attacks or Sybil attacks, where they are connected to fake nodes or fake networks and do not have access to honest nodes or the real bitcoin network. For most practical purposes, well-connected SPV nodes are secure enough, striking the right balance between resource needs, practicality, and security. For infallible security, however, nothing beats running a full blockchain node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3735 - A full blockchain node verifies a transaction by checking the entire chain of thousands of blocks below it in order to guarantee that the UTXO is not spent, whereas an SPV node checks how deep the block is buried by a handful of blocks above it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3744 - Because SPV nodes need to retrieve specific transactions in order to selectively verify them, they also create a privacy risk. Unlike full blockchain nodes, which collect all transactions within each block, the SPV node’s requests for specific data can inadvertently reveal the addresses in their wallet.</p>

<p>loc 3748 - Shortly after the introduction of SPV/lightweight nodes, the bitcoin developers added a feature called bloom filters to address the privacy risks of SPV nodes. Bloom filters allow SPV nodes to receive a subset of the transactions without revealing precisely which addresses they are interested in, through a filtering mechanism that uses probabilities rather than fixed patterns.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3762 - Bloom filters serve this function by allowing an SPV node to specify a search pattern for transactions that can be tuned toward precision or privacy. A more specific bloom filter will produce accurate results, but at the expense of revealing what addresses are used in the user’s wallet. A less specific bloom filter will produce more data about more transactions, many irrelevant to the node, but will allow the node to maintain better privacy.</p>

<p>loc 3798 - To test if a pattern is part of a bloom filter, the pattern is hashed by each hash function and the resulting bit pattern is tested against the bit array. If all the bits indexed by the hash functions are set to 1, then the pattern is probably recorded in the bloom filter. Because the bits may be set because of overlap from multiple patterns, the answer is not certain, but is rather probabilistic. In simple terms, a bloom filter positive match is a “Maybe, Yes.”</p>

<p>loc 4476 - The first transaction added to the block is a special transaction, called a generation transaction or coinbase transaction. This transaction is constructed by Jing’s node and is his reward for the mining effort. Jing’s node creates the generation transaction as a payment to his own wallet: “Pay Jing’s address 25.09094928 bitcoin.” The total amount of reward that Jing collects for mining a block is the sum of the coinbase reward (25 new bitcoins) and the transaction fees (0.09094928) from all the transactions included in the block</p>

<li>
<p>loc 4720 - With all the other fields filled, the block header is now complete and the process of mining can begin. The goal is now to find a value for the nonce that results in a block header hash that is less than the difficulty target. The mining node will need to test billions or trillions of nonce values before a nonce is found that satisfies the requirement.</p>

<p>loc 4784 - The nonce is used to vary the output of a cryptographic function, in this case to vary the SHA256 fingerprint of the phrase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4907 - we saw that the block contains the difficulty target, in a notation called “difficulty bits” or just “bits,” which in block 277,316 has the value of 0x1903a30c. This notation expresses the difficulty target as a coefficient/exponent format, with the first two hexadecimal digits for the exponent and the next six hex digits as the coefficient. In this block, therefore, the exponent is 0x19 and the coefficient is 0x03a30c. The formula to calculate the difficulty target from this representation is: target = coefficient * 2^(8 * (exponent – 3))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4932 - Every 2,016 blocks, all nodes retarget the proof-of-work difficulty. The equation for retargeting difficulty measures the time it took to find the last 2,016 blocks and compares that to the expected time of 20,160 minutes (two weeks based upon a desired 10-minute block time). The ratio between the actual timespan and desired timespan is calculated and a corresponding adjustment (up or down) is made to the difficulty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4985 - While the difficulty calibration happens every 2,016 blocks, because of an off-by-one error in the original Bitcoin Core client it is based on the total time of the previous 2,015 blocks (not 2,016 as it should be), resulting in a retargeting bias towards higher difficulty by 0.05%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5045 - Nodes maintain three sets of blocks: those connected to the main blockchain, those that form branches off the main blockchain (secondary chains), and finally, blocks that do not have a known parent in the known chains (orphans). Invalid blocks are rejected as soon as any one of the validation criteria fails and are therefore not included in any chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5048 - The “main chain” at any time is whichever chain of blocks has the most cumulative difficulty associated with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5050 - The main chain will also have branches with blocks that are “siblings” to the blocks on the main chain. These blocks are valid but not part of the main chain. They are kept for future reference, in case one of those chains is extended to exceed the main chain in difficulty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5062 - If a valid block is received and no parent is found in the existing chains, that block is considered an “orphan.” Orphan blocks are saved in the orphan block pool where they will stay until their parent is received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5065 - Orphan blocks usually occur when two blocks that were mined within a short time of each other are received in reverse order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5073 - Blocks might arrive at different nodes at different times, causing the nodes to have different perspectives of the blockchain. To resolve this, each node always selects and attempts to extend the chain of blocks that represents the most proof of work, also known as the longest chain or greatest cumulative difficulty chain.</p>

However, this was easily resolved by updating the block timestamp to account for the elapsed time.

Because the timestamp is part of the header, the change would allow miners to iterate through the values of the nonce again with different results.

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5173 - The solution was to use the coinbase transaction as a source of extra nonce values. Because the coinbase script can store between 2 and 100 bytes of data, miners started using that space as extra nonce space, allowing them to explore a much larger range of block header values to find valid blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5183 - Even the fastest consumer ASIC mining system cannot keep up with commercial systems that stack tens of thousands of these chips in giant warehouses near hydro-electric power stations. Miners now collaborate to form mining pools, pooling their hashing power and sharing the reward among thousands of participants. By participating in a pool, miners get a smaller share of the overall reward, but typically get rewarded every day, reducing uncertainty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5213 - By setting a lower difficulty for earning shares, the pool measures the amount of work done by each miner. Each time a pool miner finds a block header hash that is less than the pool difficulty, she proves she has done the hashing work to find that result. More importantly, the work to find shares contributes, in a statistically measurable way, to the overall effort to find a hash lower than the bitcoin network’s target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5228 - Most mining pools are “managed,” meaning that there is a company or individual running a pool server. The owner of the pool server is called the pool operator, and he charges pool miners a percentage fee of the earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5230 - The pool server runs specialized software and a pool-mining protocol that coordinates the activities of the pool miners. The pool server is also connected to one or more full bitcoin nodes and has direct access to a full copy of the blockchain database. This allows the pool server to validate blocks and transactions on behalf of the pool miners, relieving them of the burden of running a full node.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 5246 - centralized pool servers represent a single-point-of-failure. If the pool server is down or is slowed by a denial-of-service attack, the pool miners cannot mine. In 2011, to resolve these issues of centralization, a new pool mining method was proposed and implemented: P2Pool is a peer-to-peer mining pool, without a central operator. P2Pool works by decentralizing the functions of the pool server, implementing a parallel blockchain-like system called a share chain. A share chain is a blockchain running at a lower difficulty than the bitcoin</p>

P2Pool works by decentralizing the functions of the pool server, implementing a parallel blockchain-like system called a share chain. A share chain is a blockchain running at a lower difficulty than the bitcoin blockchain. The share chain allows pool miners to collaborate in a decentralized pool, by mining shares on the share chain at a rate of one share block every 30 seconds. Each of the blocks on the share chain records a proportionate share reward for the pool miners who contribute work, carrying the shares forward from the previous share block. When one of the share blocks also achieves the difficulty target of the bitcoin network, it is propagated and included on the bitcoin blockchain, rewarding all the pool miners who contributed to all the shares that preceded the winning share block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5256 - P2Pool mining is more complex than pool mining because it requires that the pool miners run a dedicated computer with enough disk space, memory, and Internet bandwidth to support a full bitcoin node and the P2Pool node software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5264 - Even though P2Pool reduces the concentration of power by mining pool operators, it is conceivably vulnerable to 51% attacks against the share chain itself. A much broader adoption of P2Pool does not solve the 51% attack problem for bitcoin itself. Rather, P2Pool makes bitcoin more robust overall, as part of a diversified mining ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5275 - A consensus attack cannot steal bitcoins, spend bitcoins without signatures, redirect bitcoins, or otherwise change past transactions or ownership records. Consensus attacks can only affect the most recent blocks and cause denial-of-service disruptions on the creation of future blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5277 - One attack scenario against the consensus mechanism is called the “51% attack.” In this scenario a group of miners, controlling a majority (51%) of the total network’s hashing power, collude to attack bitcoin. With the ability to mine the majority of the blocks, the attacking miners can cause deliberate “forks” in the blockchain and double-spend transactions or execute denial-of-service attacks against specific transactions or addresses. A fork/double-spend attack is one where the attacker causes previously confirmed blocks to be invalidated by forking below them and re-converging on an alternate chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5321 - There is no possible way for a solo miner to control more than a small percentage of the total mining power. However, the centralization of control caused by mining pools has introduced the risk of for-profit attacks by a mining pool operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5366 - Meta coins and meta chains are software layers implemented on top of bitcoin, either implementing a currency-inside-a-currency, or a platform/protocol overlay inside the bitcoin system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5371 - Since the introduction of the OP_RETURN transaction scripting opcode, the meta coins have been able to record metadata more directly in the blockchain, and most are migrating to using that instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5374 - Colored coins is a meta protocol that overlays information on small amounts of bitcoin. A “colored” coin is an amount of bitcoin repurposed to express another asset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5383 - It is entirely up to the users of colored coins to assign and interpret the meaning of the “color” associated with specific coins. To color the coins, the user defines the associated metadata, such as the type of issuance, whether it can be subdivided into smaller units, a symbol and description, and other related information. Once colored, these coins can be bought and sold, subdivided, and aggregated, and receive dividend payments. The colored coins can also be “uncolored” by removing the special association and redeemed for their face value in bitcoin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5415 - Think of Mastercoin as an application-layer protocol on top of bitcoin’s financial transaction transport layer, just like HTTP runs on top of TCP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5422 - Counterparty is another protocol layer implemented on top of bitcoin. Counterparty enables user currencies, tradable tokens, financial instruments, decentralized asset exchanges, and other features. Counterparty is implemented primarily using the OP_RETURN operator in bitcoin’s scripting language to record metadata that enhances bitcoin transactions with additional meaning.</p>

<p>loc 5435 - Tenebrix was the first cryptocurrency to implement an alternative proof-of-work algorithm, namely scrypt, an algorithm originally designed for password stretching (brute-force resistance). The stated goal of Tenebrix was to make a coin that was resistant to mining with GPUs and ASICs, by using a memory-intensive algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5439 - Litecoin, in addition to using scrypt as the proof-of-work algorithm, also implemented a faster block-generation time, targeted at 2.5 minutes instead of bitcoin’s 10 minutes. The resulting currency is touted as “silver to bitcoin’s gold” and is intended as a light-weight alternative currency. Due to the faster confirmation time and the 84 million total currency limit, many adherents of Litecoin believe it is better suited for retail transactions than bitcoin.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 5485 - Freicoin was introduced in July 2012. It is a demurrage currency, meaning it has a negative interest rate for stored value. Value stored in Freicoin is assessed a 4.5% APR fee, to encourage consumption and discourage hoarding of money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5497 - 2013, we saw the invention of an alternative to proof of work, called proof of stake, which forms the basis of many modern alt coins. Proof of stake is a system by which existing owners of a currency can “stake” currency as interest-bearing collateral. Somewhat like a certificate of deposit (CD), participants can reserve a portion of their currency holdings, while earning an investment return in the form of new currency (issued as interest payments) and transaction fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5502 - Peercoin was introduced in August 2012 and is the first alt coin to use a hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake algorithm to issue new currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5507 - Myriad was introduced in February 2014 and is notable because it uses five different proof-of-work algorithms (SHA256d, Scrypt, Qubit, Skein, or Myriad-Groestl) simultaneously, with difficulty varying for each algorithm depending on miner participation. The intent is to make Myriad immune to ASIC specialization and centralization as well as much more resistant to consensus attacks, because multiple mining algorithms would have to be attacked simultaneously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5538 - Primecoin was announced in July 2013. Its proof-of-work algorithm searches for prime numbers, computing Cunningham and bi-twin prime chains.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 5711 - In simple terms: don’t take control of keys away from users and don’t take transactions off the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5725 - Traditional security architecture is based upon a concept called the root of trust, which is a trusted core used as the foundation for the security of the overall system or application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5731 - This security architecture is repeated at different scales, first establishing a root of trust within the hardware of a single system, then extending that root of trust through the operating system to higher-level system services, and finally across many servers layered in concentric circles of diminishing trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5735 - Bitcoin systems can and should use the blockchain as their root of trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5753 - The level of computer maintenance required to keep a computer virus-free and trojan-free is beyond the skill level of all but a tiny minority of computer users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5773 - I personally keep the vast majority of my bitcoins (99% or more) stored on paper wallets, encrypted with BIP0038, with multiple copies locked in safes.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 5773 - I personally keep the vast majority of my bitcoins (99% or more) stored on paper wallets, encrypted with BIP0038, with multiple copies locked in safes. Keeping bitcoin offline is called cold storage and it is one of the most effective security techniques. A cold storage system is one where the keys are generated on an offline system (one never connected to the Internet) and stored offline either on paper or on digital media, such as a USB memory stick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5779 - Without general-purpose software to compromise and with limited interfaces, hardware wallets can deliver an almost foolproof level of security to nonexpert users. I expect to see hardware wallets become the predominant method of bitcoin storage. For an example of such a hardware wallet, see the Trezor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5785 - In July of 2011, a well-known bitcoin awareness and education project lost almost 7,000 bitcoins. In their effort to prevent theft, the owners had implemented a complex series of encrypted backups. In the end they accidentally lost the encryption keys, making the backups worthless and losing a fortune. Like hiding money by burying it in the desert, if you secure your bitcoin too well you might not be able to find it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5795 - Whenever a company or individual stores large amounts of bitcoin, they should consider using a multi-signature bitcoin address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5798 - Multi-signature addresses can also offer redundancy, where a single person holds several keys that are stored in different locations.</p>
