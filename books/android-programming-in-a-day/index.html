<li>
<p>loc 96 - An Android operating system, regardless of version number, is composed of five software components. They are the Linux kernel, libraries, Android runtime, application framework, and applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 113 - Just above the kernel are the Android libraries. In programming, libraries are reusable program components that make program development and computer operations easier. A few of the known libraries in Android are surface manager, media framework, SQLite, OpenGL, ES, FreeType, WebKit, SGL, SSL, and libc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 124 - Just beside the Android libraries in the second layer in the Android platform is the Android runtime. It has two of the primary components that allow most applications on your smartphone or Android device to work.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 124 - Just beside the Android libraries in the second layer in the Android platform is the Android runtime. It has two of the primary components that allow most applications on your smartphone or Android device to work. First are the core libraries. Second is the Dalvik Virtual Machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 139 - The Android application framework is the third software layer in the Android operating system. It houses the much needed higher-level services and the basic functionalities of an Android device. All of the pieces of software in the Android application framework are written as Java classes, which make them dependent on the Android runtime component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 225 - Mostly, when dealing with Java in Android development, you are actually writing your program’s code. Particularly, all the things that happen in your app will be dependent on your app’s java code. In Android Studio, your app’s main java file is located at app &gt; src &gt; main &gt; java &gt;</p>

<p>loc 225 - Mostly, when dealing with Java in Android development, you are actually writing your program’s code. Particularly, all the things that happen in your app will be dependent on your app’s java code. In Android Studio, your app’s main java file is located at app &gt; src &gt; main &gt; java &gt; com.example.admin.myapplication (or your app’s reverse domain or package name) &gt; MainActivity (or any name that you have assigned for your program). In</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 231 - For example, you will be editing the XML files for your activities saved in the app &gt; src &gt; main &gt; res &gt; layout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 231 - Also, you will be editing the XML file for the string values in your app in app &gt; src &gt; main &gt; res &gt; values &gt; strings.xml.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 247 - Writing letter case separated words (or CamelCase) is the most common naming convention for Java programmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 248 - When dealing with identifiers with multiple words, those words are separated with an uppercase first letter. For example: thisIsAVariable is a variable identifier that uses the letter case naming convention. By the way, it is common that the first letter of the identifier is in lower case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 308 - End of line comments are placed at the end of the line and starts with //. Unlike</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 473 - Content and Markup Content is the information that users will see once the XML file is processed. In Android, that’s the activity screen and the elements you add to it. On the other hand, markups are words, keywords, and syntax that allow you to define content and let the machines know what to do with your content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 478 - XML elements or tags depend on the machine that will read it. For example, XML files for Android apps cannot be processed the same way by other machines not running on Android</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 483 - By the way, having markup tags that require closing tags means that you can nest another markup construct inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 488 - An element in an XML file can contain attributes or properties. For example, a TextView element has an attribute or property of android:text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 496 - Every Android app needs four necessary components in order to be rich and decent. The components are attached in the AndroidManifest.xml — the app’s manifest file. The manifest file indicates how the components interact and how they are related. The four components are:</p>

<p>loc 496 - Every Android app needs four necessary components in order to be rich and decent. The components are attached in the AndroidManifest.xml — the app’s manifest file. The manifest file indicates how the components interact and how they are related. The four components are: Services: this component manages the processes in the background created by the app. Activities: this component is responsible for the display and UI (User Interface). It also is responsible for the actions that the user will perform within the app’s UI. Content Providers: this component manages data management and related issues. Broadcast Receivers: this component manages the communication between the app and the operating system — mainly with Android’s framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 509 - Usually, services handle boring and tedious operations needed for the app to do its thing or tasks. A good example is Facebook’s Messenger app. Even if you switch to another app, its services will still run. One of its services is to fetch messages from the server in case that somebody messages you in Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 522 - An activity represents a single screen with a user interface. For example, an email application might have one activity that shows a list of new emails, another activity to compose an email, and another activity for reading emails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 535 - public class ExampleContentProvider extends ContentProvider { <Insert the code here for ExampleContentProvider > }</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 915 - The first one is RelativeLayout. The second one is TextView. The RelativeLayout is a Viewgroup. And inside that Viewgroup is TextView, which is a View object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 957 - Many Java developers actually create package structures with the reverse domain scheme utilized as basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 974 - Libs/ - This contains third-party libraries that have been pre-compiled. These JAR archives can be used for your application. For instance, if you are creating an application that obtains data from social networking feeds, you should use a social networking library that another programmer has already made for you. You should put this in the libs/ folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1129 - The action bar is generally categorized into four functional sections. Most applications have these four sections: the application icon, view control, action buttons, and action overflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1147 - If you wish to split up your content across different action bars, you can choose from three different locations. These are the main action bar, the top bar, and the bottom bar. If you want your users to be able to quickly switch between views, you can put a spinner or a tab in the top bar of your application. If you want to display the action overflow and the actions, you should use the bottom bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1156 - you are having a hard time prioritizing your actions, you can use the FIT scheme. FIT actually stands for Frequent, Important, and Typical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1158 - An action can be considered Frequent if the users use it at least seven out of ten times whenever they visit the screen. It can also be considered Frequent if such users use it a few times in a row. An action can be considered Important if the users find this action to be cool or interesting. It can also be labeled as Important if it does not require much effort to be executed.</p>
</li>
