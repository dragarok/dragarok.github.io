<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 111 - When we first meet someone, we instinctively assess whether that person is a potential friend or foe and whether they have the power to enact those intentions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 114 - When you meet a charismatic person, you get the impression that they have a lot of power and they like you a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 167 - Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences. Reduce how quickly and how often you nod. Pause for two full seconds before you speak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 167 - Three quick tips to gain an instant charisma boost in conversation: Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences. Reduce how quickly and how often you nod. Pause for two full seconds before you speak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 209 - If you’re not fully present in an interaction, there’s a good chance that your eyes will glaze over or that your facial reactions will be a split-second delayed. Since the human mind can read facial expressions in as little as seventeen milliseconds,1 the person you’re speaking with will</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 209 - If you’re not fully present in an interaction, there’s a good chance that your eyes will glaze over or that your facial reactions will be a split-second delayed. Since the human mind can read facial expressions in as little as seventeen milliseconds,1 the person you’re speaking with will likely notice even the tiniest delays in your reactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 249 - The very next time you’re in a conversation, try to regularly check whether your mind is fully engaged or whether it is wandering elsewhere (including preparing your next sentence). Aim to bring yourself back to the present moment as often as you can by focusing on your breath or your toes for just a second, and then get back to focusing on the other person. One of my clients, after trying this exercise for the first time, reported: “I found myself relaxing, smiling, and others suddenly noticed me and smiled back without my saying a word.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 264 - Being charismatic does not depend on how much time you have but on how fully present you are in each interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 300 - Figuring out who might want to help us and who has the power to do so has always been critical to our survival. That’s why our reaction to power and warmth is wired so deep. We react to these qualities as we do to fat and sugar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 323 - with the right body language you can be charismatic without saying a word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 333 - We can’t micromanage charismatic body language. On the other hand, since our subconscious is responsible for most of our nonverbal signals, if we could direct our subconscious appropriately, then the issue would be solved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 346 - Because what’s in your mind shows up in your body and because people will catch even the briefest microexpression, to be effective, charismatic behaviors must originate in your mind. If your internal state is anticharismatic, no amount of effort and willpower can make up for it. Sooner or later, some of your underlying thoughts and feelings will show through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 374 - Knowing your internal world starts with one key insight upon which all charisma is built: your mind can’t tell fact from fiction. This is the one dimension of your internal world that can help you get into the right charismatic mental state at will, and almost instantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 408 - Charisma has three essential components: presence, power, and warmth.  Being present—paying attention to what’s going on rather than being caught up in your thoughts—can yield immense rewards. When you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued.  Because your body language telegraphs your internal state to those around you, in order to be charismatic—to exhibit presence, power, and warmth—you must display charismatic body language.  Because your mind can’t tell the difference between imagination and reality, by creating a charismatic internal state your body language will authentically display charisma.  In terms of achieving charisma, your internal state is critical. Get the internal state right, and the right charismatic behaviors and body language will pour forth automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 443 - To the outside world, your face will show the same reaction to discomfort from the sun as it would to feelings of anger or disapproval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 449 - When interacting with someone, assume that he or she will feel (at least on a subconscious level) that whatever you do relates to him or to her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 462 - Signs of fatigue can easily show up in people’s body language as lack of enthusiasm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 474 - Check in with your face from time to time; notice if it is tense. This is where the ability to stay present will help you yet again: the more present you are, the better your chances of noticing if your body language is showing tension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 482 - Take a moment to explain that you’re in discomfort due to a particular issue. For instance, if you’re feeling irritated by constant nearby construction noise, explain the problem. Giving voice to something will generally allow both of you to move on from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 499 - Our inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs. It can cause us to make premature decisions. It can handicap us in negotiations, leading us to reveal more than we should as we scramble to fill the silence, unable to bear the uncertainty of not knowing what the other person is thinking. And most important, it can lead us to feel anxious. Anxiety is a serious drawback to charisma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 554 - “Our brains are wired first to understand, then to believe, and last to disbelieve. Since disbelief requires additional cognitive effort, we get the physiological effects first. And, though this belief may last only a brief moment, it’s enough to produce an emotional and physical reassurance, which can change our thought patterns as well as help alleviate the uncomfortable feelings.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 565 - the placebo effect works even when we know we’re self-deceiving, perhaps thanks to this natural cognitive delay in disbelief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 583 - The very act of comparing and evaluating hinders our ability to be fully present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 594 - When our internal voice starts criticizing us, lashing out, it can feel like we’re under attack. Because our brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality, these internal attacks are perceived by our mind just as a real, physical attack would be, and they can generate an automatic physical reaction known as the threat response or fight-or-flight response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 610 - Self-criticism is one of the most common obstacles to great performance in any field. It’s often called the silent killer of business, because so many executives suffer from it, yet so few dare to speak out about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 623 - Interestingly, the impostor syndrome is worst among high performers. When I speak about it at Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and MIT, the room goes so silent you could hear a pin drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 656 - Any internal discomfort—either physical or mental—can impair how you feel, how you perform, and how others perceive you.  Physical tension caused by something as simple as the sun in your eyes produces the same changes in body language as a more serious discomfort, like anxiety or irritation.  Prevention is optimal: plan ahead to ensure comfort in clothing, location, and timing.  Aim to stay aware of any physical sensation of discomfort. If physical discomfort arises during an interaction, act promptly to alleviate or explain it.  Use techniques such as the responsibility transfer to reduce the feelings of anxiety, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction that play out in your body language and inhibit your charisma.  Understand that mental negativity such as anxiety, dissatisfaction, self-criticism, or self-doubt is normal and something that everyone experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 684 - If you’ve just lost a key client, for instance, think of someone you know—a mentor you have a high regard for, or a colleague you respect—who suffered a similar setback. Imagine them going through this experience. Of course, hearing them tell you their tale of woe in person would be ideal, but even simply imagining them going through this experience and telling you about it can be very helpful. (Remember, your brain won’t know the difference.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 688 - With about 7 billion people on the planet, I can absolutely guarantee you that not just one but scores of people are going through the same thing at this very moment. Rather than seeing it as one big emotion felt by one person, see a community of people struggling with it—one difficult burden shared by many. Rather than being yours alone to bear, see the issue as the depression, the shame, the sadness that is being felt by a multitude of people right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 725 - The next time you think you see coldness or reservation in someone’s face while they’re talking to you, try to remember that it could simply be the visible signs of their internal discomfort. You might be catching the surface tremors of an internal tempest, and there’s a good chance that it has nothing to do with how they feel about you or what you’ve just said. This reminder helps me on a regular basis. When I’m involved in a conversation and I catch a tone of annoyance or impatience in someone’s voice, or when I see a fleeting negative expression cross their face, sometimes I still feel instinctively dismayed. It’s hard not to assume that what I’ve just seen is a reaction to what I’ve just said. But right on the heels of this instinctive reaction comes the recognition that whatever I’ve seen may well be the sign of how they’re feeling about themselves, an itchy wool suit, or something else entirely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 761 - When your brain spins negative scenarios, remind yourself that you may not be getting an accurate perception of reality. Your brain might be following its negativity bias, playing up some elements more than others, or omitting some positives entirely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 764 - Cognitive scientist Steven Hayes suggests that we see negative thoughts as graffiti on a wall. If you’re walking down the street and you see graffiti, you may find it an ugly sight, but just because you see an ugly sight doesn’t mean you’re an ugly person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 764 - Cognitive scientist Steven Hayes suggests that we see negative thoughts as graffiti on a wall. If you’re walking down the street and you see graffiti, you may find it an ugly sight, but just because you see an ugly sight doesn’t mean you’re an ugly person. Imagine strolling along the paths of your mind. Suddenly, you notice an unpleasant thought. See it as graffiti on the wall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 782 - Depersonalize the experience. Rather than saying “I’m feeling ashamed,” try “There is shame being felt.” Imagine that you’re a scientist observing a phenomenon: “How interesting, there are self-critical thoughts arising.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 799 - Because trying to suppress a self-critical thought only makes it more central to your thinking, it’s a far better strategy to simply aim to neutralize it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 815 - But what if you happened to learn that this apparently reckless driver was actually a distraught mother whose baby was choking in the backseat, and she was desperately trying to pull over into the breakdown lane while reaching back to save her baby’s life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 821 - In most situations, we don’t know for certain what motivates a person’s actions, so we might as well choose the explanation that is most helpful to us and create a version of events that gets us into the specific mental state we need for charisma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 837 - “Maybe I’ll somehow do well tomorrow and come to know that even sleep-deprived, and in a foreign language, I can still do all right. Maybe this knowledge will be key someday when I’m faced with an even more important assignment. And I’ll be grateful for having had the uncomfortable experience I’m living through now.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 857 - One author friend reminded me of a maxim called Parkinson’s Law: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” He challenged me: “Rather than letting the writing process fill the entire year, try to write the entire book in one month. At the end of a month, what you have will certainly not be a finished book, but it’ll be more than you would have without this self-imposed deadline.” This seemed sensible, so I decided to give it a try. I imagined—as vividly as possible, with sensory-rich details—that my publisher had somehow given me an insane one-month deadline to write the entire book. And I was amazed at how fast this completely imaginary deadline became emotionally real. I even felt a knot in the pit of my stomach, a physical reminder that the clock was ticking. Was this pleasant? Definitely not. Effective? Absolutely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 865 - The key questions are: Which mental state would be most useful in this situation? And which version of reality would help you get there?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 877 - The act of committing things to writing has been shown to be critical both in changing a person’s mind7 and in making imagined stories feel more real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 892 - Think of one person in your life who has aggrieved you. ♦ Take a blank page and write that person a letter saying anything and everything you wish you had ever told them. Really get into this—you have nothing to lose. Make sure you write it out by hand. ♦ When you’ve gotten absolutely everything off your mind and onto paper, put the letter aside. ♦ Take a fresh sheet and write their response just the way you wish they would respond. You might have them taking responsibility for their actions, acknowledging and apologizing for everything they’ve ever done that hurt you. You don’t need to find any justification for their actions, just an acknowledgment and an apology. It’s your imagination, so you get to decide exactly what you’d like to hear. This exercise may feel alien, awkward, or unreal at first—that’s the case for many people. And you may not feel an immediate internal shift. However, over the next few days you may be amazed to feel this “new reality” gradually taking hold. You may feel that you did get the closure you needed. To accelerate the process, simply reread the apology letter nightly for a few days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 951 - Though it sounds counterintuitive, rather than trying to suppress, ignore, or power through them, your goal is to give your full attention to the very sensations you’d instinctively want to push away. Focusing on the minute sensations of your physical discomfort serves a dual purpose: it gives your mind something concrete to focus on other than its growing conviction that this situation is unbearable. It also has the advantage of bringing you instantly into full presence, a key component of charisma. In fact, this technique, called delving into sensations, can help you access charismatic presence even during highly uncomfortable situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1020 - Skillfully handle internal discomfort with a three-step process: destigmatize your discomfort, neutralize your negative thoughts, and rewrite your perception of reality.  Destigmatize and dedramatize uncomfortable feelings by remembering that they are survival instincts and a natural part of the human experience. Think of others who’ve gone through this before—especially people you admire—and see yourself as part of a community of human beings experiencing the same feeling at the same moment.  Neutralize unhelpful negative thoughts by remembering that the mind often distorts reality and filters your environment to highlight the negative. Think of your negative thoughts as graffiti on a wall—you may find it an ugly sight, but just because you see an ugly sight doesn’t mean you’re an ugly person.  Rewrite reality by considering a few helpful alternatives to your current perspective. For maximum effect, write down your new realities by hand and describe them in vivid detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1029 - For advanced practice, delve into the physical sensations of discomfort. Focusing on the sensations gives your mind something concrete to focus on, drawing your attention away from your feeling that the experience is unbearable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1074 - Some people experience very strong results from their first visualization and others less. But, as with any other skill, your ability to create realistic visualizations will improve with practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1074 - Some people experience very strong results from their first visualization and others less. But, as with any other skill, your ability to create realistic visualizations will improve with practice. The next time you do this exercise, aim to create images that are even more detailed. Guided imagery must be precise, vivid, and detailed to be effective,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1082 - A week from now, or a year from now, will any of this matter? This, too, shall pass. Yes, it will. Look for little miracles unfolding right now. Love the confusion. What if you could trust the Universe, even with this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1082 - A week from now, or a year from now, will any of this matter? This, too, shall pass. Yes, it will. Look for little miracles unfolding right now. Love the confusion. What if you could trust the Universe, even with this? Axioms like these can be a saving grace in moments of panic, when our brain goes blank and all we can remember are simple phrases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1096 - By adding this particular gesture (and words, if any) to the end of your visualization, when your confidence is soaring, you’ll engage your entire physiology and “lock in” the triumphant feeling, maximizing the effect of the exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1159 - Gratitude has a special advantage for those of us who sometimes find it uncomfortable to connect with others. It can give us charismatic warmth without having to connect with anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1172 - If you can access gratitude, an instant change will sweep through your body language from head to toe: your face will soften, your whole body will relax. Your body language will emanate both warmth and a particular grounded confidence that people will find very appealing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1205 - Have you ever felt flooded with relief after finding an important item you thought had been lost or stolen? (It happens to me every time I lose my keys.) This instinctive sweeping sense of gratitude can be remarkably powerful, and it taps into wells of gratitude deeper than almost any other practice. You can manufacture this gratitude-producing sense of relief by imagining your own funeral. Within seconds, this visualization can bring you into a state of emotional aliveness and, as you realize you still have your life, to a state of gratitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1245 - One simple but effective way to start is to try to find three things you like about the person you want to feel goodwill toward. No matter whom it is you’re talking to, find three things to appreciate or approve of—even if these are as small as “their shoes are shined” or “they were on time.” When you start searching for positive elements, your mental state changes accordingly and then sweeps through your body language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1306 - three key concepts: Self-confidence is our belief in our ability to do or to learn how to do something. Self-esteem is how much we approve of or value ourselves. It’s often a comparison-based evaluation (whether measured against other people or against our own internal standards for approval). Self-compassion is how much warmth we can have for ourselves, especially when we’re going through a difficult experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1322 - self-compassion is feeling that what happened to you is unfortunate, whereas self-pity is feeling that what happened to you is unfair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1358 - Simply put, Metta is the conscious practice of developing kind intentions toward all beings. When the brains of dedicated Metta practitioners were examined and tested by neuroscientists, significant differences came to light. Not only did they emit deeper brain waves, they also bounced back from stress scenarios much faster, and they showed particular enhancement in the left frontal lobe of their cortexes, the “happy region” of the brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1369 - Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take two or three deep breaths. As you inhale, imagine drawing in masses of clean air toward the top of your head; then let it whoosh through you from head to toe as you exhale, washing all concerns away. ♦ Think of any occasion in your life when you performed a good deed, however great or small. Just one good action—one moment of truth, generosity, or courage. Focus on that memory for a moment. ♦ Now think of one being, whether present or past, mythical or actual—Jesus, Buddha, Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama—who could have great affection for you. This could be a person, a pet, or even a stuffed animal. ♦ Picture this being in your mind. Imagine their warmth, their kindness and compassion. See it in their eyes and face. Feel their warmth radiating toward you, enveloping you. ♦ See yourself through their eyes with warmth, kindness, and compassion. Feel them giving you complete forgiveness for everything your inner critic says is wrong. You are completely and absolutely forgiven. You have a clean slate. ♦ Feel them giving you wholehearted acceptance. You are accepted as you are, right now, at this stage of growth, imperfections and all. You are perfect. At this stage of development, you are perfect. At this stage of growth, you are perfect. At this stage of perfection, you are perfect. With everything that’s in your head and heart, you are perfect. ♦ With all your imperfections, you are perfect. ♦ For this phase of growth, you are perfect. ♦ You are fully approved just the way you are, at this stage of development, right now.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 1390 - As Germer puts it: “A moment of self-compassion can change your entire day. A string of such moments can change the course of your life.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1448 - Plan a warm-up period that allows you to gradually ramp up to the level you want. When you want to ensure peak charismatic performance, don’t expect yourself to be on top of your game, going from zero to full charisma instantly and at will. You can’t rely on pure willpower to get you there. In fact, it’s important to understand just how limited our daily reserves of willpower really are.13</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1464 - If, at dinner, you want to broadcast absolute self-confidence, make sure that the day of and especially the hours leading up to the dinner do not include meetings or interactions that could make you feel bad about yourself. Rather than just showing up at dinner, plan a warm-up that will boost your self-esteem: have coffee with someone who makes you feel good about yourself, or plan an activity (play a sport or a musical instrument) that makes you feel competent or accomplished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1472 - I curate my playlists considering both tempo and lyrics, and when preparing for a key moment, I’m careful to choose songs that correspond with the mood I’m trying to achieve. I have playlists for self-confidence, warmth, empathy, and patience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1509 - To make visualizations most effective, vividly engage all five senses in your imagination.  You can increase both warmth and confidence by practicing gratitude, goodwill, and compassion for others as well as for yourself.  Just as professional athletes and performers do, plan a gradual warm-up to reach your peak charismatic performance. Before important events, avoid experiences that would impair your mental state and plan warmth- and confidence-boosting activities instead.  Your body affects your mind. Flip the visualization technique on its head and practice adopting the right posture and facial expressions to access more of almost any desired internal state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1519 - four distinct kinds of charisma: focus, visionary, kindness, and authority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1679 - If you’re naturally uncomfortable in large social gatherings, the next time you’re at a party, don’t force yourself to be sociable right away or to be “on” for the whole evening. Instead, try these easy tweaks. Give yourself five minutes after you arrive to hang back and observe. Then give yourself little “introversion breaks” during the party: five-minute pockets of solitude. I know one highly charismatic introvert who often does exactly that during both social and business events. When she reemerges to mingle, people frequently comment on how radiant she is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1716 - The same amount of eye contact that would be welcomed as an honest, straightforward gaze in most of North America could be seen as aggressive and obnoxious in parts of Asia. Though presence, warmth, and power are the fundamental elements of charisma, how they get expressed varies somewhat from culture to culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1734 - Choosing the right charisma style depends on your personality, goals, and the situation. You can alternate among different charisma styles or even blend them together. Don’t force yourself into a charisma style that is just too awkward for you. Doing so would negatively affect how you feel and how others perceive you.  The more charisma styles you can access, the more versatile and confident you will be.  Stretch out of your comfort zone in low-stakes situations.  Stick with styles you already know well in high-stakes situations.  Let goodwill be your safety net. Coming from a place of genuine goodwill gives you the best chance of getting your charisma right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1760 - The other reason first impressions have such an impact is that often they actually are right. In one study conducted at the University of Texas at Austin, people were able to accurately judge nine out of ten personality traits by looking at a single photograph. The traits in question were extroversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, likability, self-esteem, loneliness, religiosity, and even political orientation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1799 - They approached college students on a campus, sometimes wearing hippie clothes and other times wearing straight clothes, and asked for change to make a phone call. When they were dressed in the same style as the student, the student said yes two-thirds of the time. When they were dressed in the opposite style, the student said yes less than half the time.6 One company that understood this principle and used it to its advantage was American Express. They made their first good move when they started sending their salespeople to college campuses dressed like college students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1848 - First things first: make sure your right hand is free. Shift anything it may be holding to your left hand well in advance. You don’t want to have to fumble at the last moment. Avoid holding a drink in your right hand, especially if it’s a cold drink, as the condensation will make your hand feel cold and clammy. Before shaking someone’s hand, whether you are a man or a woman, rise if you’re seated. And keep your hands out of your pockets: visible hands make you look more open and honest. Make sure to use plenty of eye contact, and smile warmly but briefly: too much smiling could make you appear overeager. Keep your head straight, without tilting it in any way, and face the person fully. Keep your hand perfectly perpendicular, neither dominant (palm down) nor submissive (palm up). If you’re in doubt, angle your thumb straight to the ceiling. Open wide the space between your thumb and index finger to make sure you get optimal thumb-web contact. Ensure contact between the palms of your hands by keeping your palm flat—not cupped—and by draping your hand across your partner’s diagonally. Try to wrap your fingers around your partner’s hand, scaling them one by one, as if you were giving a hug with your hand. You will almost have your index finger on their pulse—almost, but not quite. Once full contact is made, lock your thumb down and squeeze firmly, about as much as your partner does. Shake from the elbow (not the wrist), linger for a moment if you want to convey particular warmth, and step back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1868 - offer a compliment about something the person is wearing. This would be a great opener when you’re aiming to broadcast either kindness charisma or focus charisma. It can also be a good way to balance out the power in your authority charisma if you think a more subdued version of your power is needed. Continue with an open-ended question, such as “What’s the story behind it?” The word story has a very strong emotional effect on most people—it sends them straight into storytelling mode, which instantly changes the rapport between the two of you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1873 - Another good question to break the ice with is “Where are you from?” No matter what the answer, it will encourage further dialogue. Whether they answer “New York” or “New Delhi,” if you’re not from that area, you can follow up with “What was it like growing up there?” The smaller the town of origin, the more delighted they will be that you have expressed interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1882 - If they start asking about you and you want to refocus the conversation on them, use the bounce back technique. Answer the question with a fact, add a personal note, and redirect the question to them,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1887 - Instead of saying “I read a great article on that subject in the New York Times,” try “You might enjoy the recent New York Times article on the subject.” Or simply insert “You know…” before any sentence to make them instantly perk up and pay attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1901 - So how can you gracefully exit a conversation? First, don’t wait too long to end it. Otherwise, you and your partner will feel the strain and become uncomfortable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1910 - “You know, based on what you’ve just said, you really should check out this Web site. If you have a card, I’ll send you the link.” As soon as your counterpart gives you a business card, you have the perfect opportunity to say, “Great! I’ll e-mail you soon. It was a pleasure meeting you.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1914 - You can also draw others into the conversation as they pass by—a group of three or four is always easier to take leave of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1927 - First impressions happen within seconds and can affect not only the rest of the interaction but also the rest of your relationship with that person.  People feel most comfortable with those who are similar to them in some way, including appearance and behavior. Do your homework and decide how much you want to adapt your dress and word choice to your environment.  A good handshake can go a long way. Likewise, a bad one can leave an unfavorable and lasting first impression. It’s worth spending some time perfecting the right way to greet someone.  Great conversationalists keep the spotlight on the other person and make them feel good about themselves.  Know how to gracefully exit a conversation, leaving others with positive feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1956 - Presence is a cornerstone of effective listening. You already have all the tools you need to avoid mind-wandering while someone else is talking: If zoning out is the issue, bring yourself back to the moment by focusing on physical sensations, like the feeling in your toes or your breath flowing in and out of your body. If impatience is the issue, handle it by delving into the minute physical sensations you’re feeling. Then get back to the person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1960 - with feel truly understood. Good listeners know never, ever to interrupt—not even if the impulse to do so comes from excitement about something the other person just said. No matter how congratulatory and warm your input, it will always result in their feeling at least a twinge of resentment or frustration at not having been allowed to complete their sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1965 - Great listeners know to let others interrupt them. When someone interrupts you, let them! Were they right to interrupt you? Of course not. But even if they were wrong, it’s not worth making them feel wrong; your job instead is to make them feel right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1970 - Master listeners know one extra trick, one simple but extraordinarily effective habit that will make people feel truly listened to and understood: they pause before they answer. The pianist Artur Schnabel once said, “The notes I handle no better than many pianists. But the pauses between the notes—ah, that is where the art resides.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1976 - When someone has spoken, see if you can let your facial expression react first, showing that you’re absorbing what they’ve just said and giving their brilliant statement the consideration it deserves. Only then, after about two seconds, do you answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2036 - The next time you’re given a compliment, the following steps will help you skillfully handle the moment: Stop. Absorb the compliment. Enjoy it if you can. Let that second of absorption show on your face. Show the person that they’ve had an impact. Thank them. Saying “Thank you very much” is enough, but you can take it a step further by thanking them for their thoughtfulness or telling them that they’ve made your day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2057 - Don’t try to impress people. Let them impress you, and they will love you for it. Believe it or not, you don’t need to sound smart. You just need to make them feel smart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2092 - When you tell someone, “No problem,” “Don’t worry,” or “Don’t hesitate to call,” for example, there’s a chance their brain will remember “problem,” “worry,” or “hesitate” instead of your desire to support them. To counter this negative effect, use phrases like “We’ll take care of it” or “Please feel free to call anytime.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2121 - When the MIT Media Lab concluded that they could predict the success of sales calls without listening to a single word, these are the only two measurements they needed: Ratio of speaking to listening Amount of voice fluctuation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2158 - Never interrupt people, and occasionally pause a second or two before you answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2159 - People associate you with the feelings you produce in them. Avoid creating negative associations: don’t make them feel bad or wrong.  Make people feel good, especially about themselves. Don’t try to impress them—let them impress you, and they will love you for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2164 - To emanate vocal power, use a slow, measured tempo; insert pauses between your sentences; and drop your intonation at the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2166 - To emanate vocal warmth, you need to do only one thing: smile, or even just imagine smiling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2207 - Within organizations, leaders’ emotions always propagate fastest because people are strongly affected by those in a position of power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2207 - Within organizations, leaders’ emotions always propagate fastest because people are strongly affected by those in a position of power (we can thank our survival instincts for this, too). Through emotional contagion, your emotions can strongly affect your followers’ effectiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2220 - This tendency to mimic the body language of others is technically called limbic resonance, and it’s hardwired into the human brain. Limbic resonance is made possible thanks to a certain class of neurons called oscillators, which coordinate people physically by regulating how and when their bodies move together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2225 - Imitating someone’s body language is an easy way to establish trust and rapport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2262 - Mirroring is also one of the few techniques that can help overcome a bad first impression. It’s extraordinarily effective. In fact, I can tell you that although I teach this material, the techniques still work on me even when I realize people are using them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2272 - Once you’re in a mirrored position, spend your entire listening time in that mode: as long as you’re listening, match your body language to hers. Only when it’s your turn to speak should you start infusing the interaction with warmth, caring, and compassion through your voice, face, and eyes. As you speak, gradually shift into a more relaxed, calm, and, eventually, confident posture. There’s a good chance that she’ll follow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2272 - Once you’re in a mirrored position, spend your entire listening time in that mode: as long as you’re listening, match your body language to hers. Only when it’s your turn to speak should you start infusing the interaction with warmth, caring, and compassion through your voice, face, and eyes. As you speak, gradually shift into a more relaxed, calm, and, eventually, confident posture. There’s a good chance that she’ll follow. Mirror-then-lead is a smart strategy when the person you’re interacting with needs reassurance—when they’re feeling nervous or timid, anxious or awkward, stiff or withdrawn. With any of these emotional states, mirror them to establish comfort and rapport, and then gradually draw them out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2279 - Say you’re meeting with a manager who has denied a request you made, and who is sitting in a defensive position—leaning back with his arms and legs crossed and his hands balled into fists. Rather than mirroring, try breaking him out of his posture by handing him something: a piece of paper or a pen—whatever works. And then, as soon as he’s in a new position, distract him by giving him new information or changing the subject while you mirror his posture to reestablish rapport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2311 - The next time you want to establish warm rapport with someone, avoid a confrontational seating arrangement and instead sit either next to or at a 90-degree angle from them. These are the positions in which we feel most comfortable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2318 - If you want someone to feel comfortable, avoid seating them with their back to an open space, particularly if others are moving behind them. This kind of seating position causes the breathing rate, heart rate, and blood pressure to increase rapidly, especially if the person’s back is toward an open door or a window at ground level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2336 - Eye contact is so meaningful to us that our brains are hardwired to experience separation distress whenever someone with whom we have significant eye contact turns away. One good way to avoid creating this anxiety is to keep eye contact for three full seconds at the end of your interaction with someone. This may sound short, but it’ll actually feel endless!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2371 - The next time you’re in a conversation, try to regularly check whether your eyes are feeling tense. If you feel the slightest bit of tension around your eyes, aim to relax them. You can use any favorite quick visualization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2406 - That’s how a gorilla charging through the jungle wants to look: big, loud, and scary. In human terms, we read confidence the same way: how much space people are willing to take up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2419 - “What’s your breathing like right now?” Anytime your breathing is shallow, you activate the stress response. It’s hard to feel calm, relaxed, and confident when you’re not getting enough oxygen and your body thinks it’s in fight-or-flight mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2438 - Composed people exhibit a level of stillness, which is sometimes described as poise. They avoid extraneous, superfluous gestures such as fidgeting with their clothes, their hair, or their faces, incessantly nodding their heads, or saying “um” before sentences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2447 - When you want to increase your poise, there are three major issues to look out for. The first is excessive or rapid nodding. Nodding once for emphasis or to express agreement is fine and can be an effective communication method, but nodding three or four times in rapid succession is not. This is what one of my clients has come to call “the bobble head.” The second hindrance is excessive verbal reassurance: making a sound, such as “uh-huh,” or a half-sentence, such as “Oh, I agree.” Done once, and consciously, this is fine; multiple times per sentence is not. The third issue is restlessness or fidgeting (tapping your pencil or foot, or rearranging items on the table). Fidgeting decreases presence, thus charisma. Even when you have warmth, confidence, and are mentally present, if you are physically restless, you can’t be charismatic. Your body language is sending distracting signals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2470 - Be aware, however, that broadcasting too much power can come across as either arrogant or intimidating for some people. The warmth-enhancing techniques you gained earlier in this chapter, such as keeping your eyes in soft focus, will counter this. You can also aim to bring your chin down a few degrees—imagine a king bowing his head to a noble emissary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2493 - To communicate warmth, aim to make people feel comfortable: respect their personal space, mirror their body language, and keep your eyes relaxed.  When people come to you in need of reassurance, first mirror their body language, then lead them to more calm, open, and confident positions.  When people are defensive, break their body language lock by handing them something to look at or something they will have to lean forward to take.  To project power, take up space (be the big gorilla) and be still (adopt a regal posture).  Cut out verbal and nonverbal reassurances like head bobbing and excessive uh-huh-ing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2544 - You could indeed ask your opponents for their help or ask them for a favor. Better still, ask them for something they can give without incurring any cost: their opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2548 - Find ways to remind them of any help they’ve given you in the past. Express your appreciation and gratitude, highlight the choice they made, the effort they put in; and if they put their reputation on the line for you in any way, play it up. Remember, it’ll make them rationalize their actions in your favor. “Wow, I really did go all-out for this person. I must really like them.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2557 - The most effective and credible compliments are those that are both personal and specific. For instance, instead of “Great job,” you could say, “You did a great job,” or, better yet, “The way you kept your calm when that client became obnoxious was impressive.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2561 - When you show people how they’ve impacted you, they feel that they’ve in a sense made you. This sense of ownership gives them a vested interest, and they identify with you; you become part of their identity. Therefore, they feel more responsibility for ensuring your success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2591 - Hostility is often nothing but the external manifestation of internal turmoil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2591 - Hostility is often nothing but the external manifestation of internal turmoil. If you need a compassion boost, consider an alternate reality. Imagine that just a few hours ago they saw a beloved parent die.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2591 - Hostility is often nothing but the external manifestation of internal turmoil. If you need a compassion boost, consider an alternate reality. Imagine that just a few hours ago they saw a beloved parent die. Remember, it’s not for their sake that you’re doing this but for yours. It will reduce the level of toxicity in your body and make the experience less frustrating for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2644 - Candles and firelight have the same positive distracting effect. This is why they’re so prized in romantic situations, when comfort and ease are key. These constantly moving elements give people the feeling that there’s something happening in the background that they can turn their attention to when they need a distraction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2651 - The right body language for delivering bad news is one of warmth: care, concern, understanding, and empathy. Essentially, demonstrate as much kindness charisma as you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2694 - If possible, don’t mention their actions at all. Just explain what’s going on for you: “When I don’t see a finished presentation until the last minute, I feel anxious.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2710 - Once you’ve started on a positive note, you can bring up the actual issue you want to address. Tell people exactly what you want to see from them, as opposed to what you don’t want to see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2713 - When you tell the person you are criticizing the corrective action you’d like to see, depersonalize the behavior change just as you had the criticism. Rather than asking, “Could you get the presentation done earlier?” say, “In the future, I’d greatly appreciate it if the presentation could be ready a few days in advance.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2727 - You can tell someone that you think they’re wrong with a look, intonation, or gesture just as eloquently as you can in words. So use all the tools in your arsenal to stay in an internal state of calm and goodwill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2735 - When closing the conversation, if you can, aim to end on a positive note. Remember how important beginnings and endings are—they can color the whole interaction. This is when you can put the emphasis on three important points: Next steps: Review the steps that will be taken to improve the situation, particularly if you’re going to do any of it together. Give the sense of constructive, forward motion. Appreciation: Tell them how much you appreciate how well they took your feedback. Praise even the slightest good effort here; you’re providing positive reinforcement so they’ll improve over time. A positive future: Bring up anything that both of you can look forward to in the future, such as exciting events or upcoming projects—whatever conveys the fact that you’re looking forward to future interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2749 - One of my very first clients told me that he actually welcomed making minor mistakes, especially early on in a business relationship. “Most people do such a piss-poor job of apologizing that just by being halfway decent at it, you’ll be head and shoulders above the rest.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2773 - While you listen, be fully present, and try to avoid preparing your response. Instead, focus your entire attention on determining precisely what the complaint is. Ask questions to make sure you understand. If someone says, “I just don’t feel good about the way this meeting went,” ask, “Could you tell me more? I really want to understand. What is it about the meeting that made you uncomfortable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2799 - On the phone, always ask, “Is this a good time for you?” before launching into conversation. No matter how important your information or how pleasant your call, bad timing means bad results for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2819 - Do not answer the phone in a warm or friendly manner. Instead, answer crisply and professionally. Then, only after you hear who is calling, let warmth or even enthusiasm pour forth in your voice. This simple technique is an easy and effective way to make people feel special.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2862 - You, too, will often be communicating with attention-starved audiences who will devote only part of their attention to what you are saying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2862 - You, too, will often be communicating with attention-starved audiences who will devote only part of their attention to what you are saying. If you can keep this one fact firmly in mind while you craft your presentation, and design your speech accordingly, you’ll be more effective than 80 percent of the speakers out there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2867 - Select the single most important idea you want to convey and make it as crystal clear and easy to understand as you possibly can. Ideally, you should be able to articulate your message in one sentence. Within this one main message, have three to five key supporting points. The human brain thinks in triads (from Olympic medals to fairy tales, it’s three medals, three princes, three bears), and it cannot immediately comprehend numbers greater than four.* Each one of your supporting points should open with entertaining anecdotes, fascinating facts, compelling statistics, great metaphors, examples, and analogies. Stories have a particularly strong impact on people. In fact, audiences will often remember first the story, and only second the point the story was making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2869 - Within this one main message, have three to five key supporting points. The human brain thinks in triads (from Olympic medals to fairy tales, it’s three medals, three princes, three bears), and it cannot immediately comprehend numbers greater than four.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2872 - Stories have a particularly strong impact on people. In fact, audiences will often remember first the story, and only second the point the story was making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2888 - Just as you want to start on a high note, you also want to end on a high note, so avoid ending with Q&amp;A. It’s hard to have a question-and-answer period as compelling and energetic as your main speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2937 - Charismatic speakers know how to give the impression that they’re as comfortable walking across the stage as they would be walking across their living room. This is called owning the stage, and there are three tricks to making it happen. First, when you stand, be sure to have a wide stance, well balanced on both feet. Not only will you feel more confident, you’ll also look more confident, more stable, than if you were standing on one foot. Wide, stable stances also help you to project confidence. Be the gorilla! Second, practice without a podium or a lectern. Speaking behind one can give the impression that you’re fearful to venture out, and prefer staying behind the safety of a shield. It also makes the presentation much more static. Think of the stereotype of a boring presentation: a lecturer who stands immobile at his lectern, reading from his notes in a monotone voice. Moving comfortably around the stage will make you appear much more confident, powerful, and charismatic. Third, find the right volume to project confidence. This is tricky, as so much can depend on the microphone you’re given that day or how the sound system is set up. Your best bet is, just before the speech, to ask a few people sitting in the back of the room to be your sound experts and give you a prearranged signal to raise or lower your volume if need be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2953 - To make your audience feel particularly special, speak as if you were sharing a secret. Another way to make people feel special as you roam about the stage is to give one to two seconds of eye contact per person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2975 - Today, when learning a new speech, I’ll often still include notes to myself every few pages: Pause. Breathe. Slow Down. Though this may feel unnecessary in the comfort of home or office, things are very different on stage.</p>

<p>loc 2994 - I would use one blue bar for a one-beat pause, two red bars for a two-beat pause (having the difference both in color and in markings helps in the heat of the moment, when your mind is racing and you can’t think clearly). I would also underline any part that needed warmth, to indicate that I should smile. Yes, it really worked—people actually told me I seemed wonderfully at ease, fluid, spontaneous, and natural.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 3011 - business moguls and entertainers make mistakes purposefully to make themselves more relatable to the audience. Sam Walton (the founder of Wal-mart) would drop his notes on his way to the lectern. Frank Sinatra would carefully mess up his shirt collar before stepping on stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3089 - &ldquo;Expressing high performance expectations&rdquo; of people while &ldquo;communicating a high degree of confidence&rdquo; in their abillity to meet those expectations was the hallmark of charismatic leadership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3138 - You&rsquo;re going to have to compensate for your charisma in order to limit the jealousy and resentment others may feel. You have three choices: you can refuse the glory, reflect the glory, or transfer the glory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3164 - Giving People a sense of ownership for your success is a great way to prevent resentment and engender good feelings, such as pride and loyalty, instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3187 - The Justification-Appreciation-Laying-out-the-Impact sequence creates a feeling of Responsibility (JALIR). It gives people a feeling of vested interest in your success. Give them as much credit as you can. Make them feel that they own your success and they will feel driven to help you continue to succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3265 - Because charismatic people seem endowed with extra powers, we expect more of them than we do of others. We expect greater results and will not be content, much less impressed, with good but not extraordinary performance. If their performance is poor, the criticism can be much more severe than it would be for an &ldquo;average person.&rdquo; When asked what becomes of the failed charismatics in the world of business, Harvard professor Rakesh Khurana says: &ldquo;We do what we&rsquo;ve always done to our failed messiahs: we crucify them.&rdquo;</p>
