<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 92 - The science of the kundalini is an ancient vidya that has been passed through an oral tradition in strict disciplic succession to worthy recipients. The science remains just as intact today. All it requires is for one to walk the path with great determination and tenacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 618 - When you don’t react, a sense of ease arises. Resistance goes away. When you resist something, you have to exert double the force, it is exhausting and demoralizing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 643 - Gratitude and mindfulness are like chopsticks. You need both to hold the food of temptation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 668 - How we accept what comes to us greatly determines our emotional state and such state in return largely affects our response to those situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 672 - It is easier to swim in a pond than in a whirlpool. When you understand that you don’t have to react to your emotions or thoughts while you are meditating on chakras, they become less intense. As their intensity decreases, they no longer remain a whirlpool but become a silent pond and then you see what lies at the bottom. Everything becomes crystal clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 681 - These are self-deprecating thoughts that leaves the meditator vulnerable. They make you feel as if you are inadequate, as if you wouldn’t ever get there. Your weak moments, or failures of the past, begin to flash in your inner eye and all you see is what all you lack as opposed to what you have within you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 688 - The second stage is a realization that all thoughts are empty in their own right. They are devoid of any essence, that if I don’t give them importance they can’t do anything on their own. If you observe carefully, you’ll notice that all visible phenomena have a point of origin, a life of certain duration, and a point of termination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 912 - chose faith over self-doubt. I picked discipline over procrastination. I settled for hope over despair. I kept meditating like the Ganges – ceaseless and flowing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
