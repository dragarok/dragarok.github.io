<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 121 - Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man’s world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 226 - Introverts are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling, said Jung, extroverts to the external life of people and activities. Introverts focus on the meaning they make of the events swirling around them; extroverts plunge into the events themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 226 - Introverts are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling, said Jung, extroverts to the external life of people and activities. Introverts focus on the meaning they make of the events swirling around them; extroverts plunge into the events themselves. Introverts recharge their batteries by being alone; extroverts need to recharge when they don’t socialize enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 245 - Introverts often work more slowly and deliberately. They like to focus on one task at a time and can have mighty powers of concentration. They’re relatively immune to the lures of wealth and fame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 249 - Introverts, in contrast, may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas. They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family. They listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation. They tend to dislike conflict. Many have a horror of small talk, but enjoy deep discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 258 - Shyness is inherently painful; introversion is not. One reason that people confuse the two concepts is that they sometimes overlap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 302 - Many introverts are also “highly sensitive,” which sounds poetic, but is actually a technical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 302 - Many introverts are also “highly sensitive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 304 - You may be quicker than others to feel sickened by violence and ugliness, and you likely have a very strong conscience. When you were a child you were probably called “shy,” and to this day feel nervous when you’re being evaluated, for example when giving a speech or on a first date. Later we’ll examine why this seemingly unrelated collection of attributes tends to belong to the same person and why this person is often introverted. (No one knows exactly how many introverts are highly sensitive, but we know that 70 percent of sensitives are introverts, and the other 30 percent tend to report needing a lot of “down time.”) All of this complexity means that not everything you read in Quiet will apply to you, even if you consider yourself a true-blue introvert. For one thing, we’ll spend some time talking about shyness and sensitivity, while you might have neither of these traits. That’s OK. Take what applies to you, and use the rest to improve your relationships with others. Having said all this, in Quiet we’ll try not to get too hung up on definitions. Strictly defining</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 304 - You may be quicker than others to feel sickened by violence and ugliness, and you likely have a very strong conscience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 305 - When you were a child you were probably called “shy,” and to this day feel nervous when you’re being evaluated,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 306 - and to this day feel nervous when you’re being evaluated,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 620 - shirt, conservative tie, rolled-up sleeves, and a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 794 - He has trouble elbowing his way into class discussions; in some classes he barely speaks at all. He prefers to contribute only when he believes he has something insightful to add, or honest-to-God disagrees with someone. This sounds reasonable, but Don feels as if he should be more comfortable talking just so he can fill up his share of available airtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 890 - The more a person talks, the more other group members direct their attention to him, which means that he becomes increasingly powerful as a meeting goes on. It also helps to speak fast; we rate quick talkers as more capable and appealing than slow talkers. All of this would be fine if more talking were correlated with greater insight, but research suggests that there’s no such link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 908 - The “Bus to Abilene” anecdote reveals our tendency to follow those who initiate action—any action. We are similarly inclined to empower dynamic speakers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 957 - The lesson, says Collins, is clear. We don’t need giant personalities to transform companies. We need leaders who build not their own egos but the institutions they run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 979 - His hypothesis was that extroverted leaders enhance group performance when employees are passive, but that introverted leaders are more effective with proactive employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1267 - One of the most interesting findings, echoed by later studies, was that the more creative people tended to be socially poised introverts. They were interpersonally skilled but “not of an especially sociable or participative temperament.” They described themselves as independent and individualistic. As teens, many had been shy and solitary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1269 - solitary. These findings don’t mean that introverts are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1273 - introverts prefer to work independently, and solitude can be a catalyst to innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1287 - The New Groupthink elevates teamwork above all else. It insists that creativity and intellectual achievement come from a gregarious place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1351 - We failed to realize that what makes sense for the asynchronous, relatively anonymous interactions of the Internet might not work as well inside the face-to-face, politically charged, acoustically noisy confines of an open-plan office. Instead of distinguishing between online and in-person interaction, we used the lessons of one to inform our thinking about the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1391 - What’s so magical about solitude? In many fields, Ericsson told me, it’s only when you’re alone that you can engage in Deliberate Practice, which he has identified as the key to exceptional achievement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1395 - Deliberate Practice is best conducted alone for several reasons. It takes intense concentration, and other people can be distracting. It requires deep motivation, often self-generated. But most important, it involves working on the task that’s most challenging to you personally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1450 - Open-plan offices have been found to reduce productivity and impair memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1455 - excessive stimulation seems to impede learning: a recent study found that people learn better after a quiet stroll through the woods than after a noisy walk down a city street. Another study, of 38,000 knowledge workers across different sectors, found that the simple act of being interrupted is one of the biggest barriers to productivity. Even multitasking, that prized feat of modern-day office warriors, turns out to be a myth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1510 - group brainstorming doesn’t actually work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1525 - “evidence from science suggests that business people must be insane to use brainstorming groups,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1525 - The “evidence from science suggests that business people must be insane to use brainstorming groups,” writes the organizational psychologist Adrian Furnham. “If you have talented and motivated people, they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1536 - Participants in brainstorming sessions usually believe that their group performed much better than it actually did, which points to a valuable reason for their continued popularity—group brainstorming makes people feel attached. A worthy goal, so long as we understand that social glue, as opposed to creativity, is the principal benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1579 - Peer pressure, in other words, is not only unpleasant, but can actually change your view of a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1610 - The most effective teams are composed of a healthy mix of introverts and extroverts, studies show, and so are many leadership structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1612 - We also need to create settings in which people are free to circulate in a shifting kaleidoscope of interactions, and to disappear into their private workspaces when they want to focus or simply be alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1691 - Many of the children turned out exactly as Kagan had expected. The high-reactive infants, the 20 percent who’d hollered at the mobiles bobbing above their heads, were more likely to have developed serious, careful personalities. The low-reactive infants—the quiet ones—were more likely to have become relaxed and confident types. High and low reactivity tended to correspond, in other words, to introversion and extroversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1719 - Kagan hypothesized that infants born with an especially excitable amygdala would wiggle and howl when shown unfamiliar objects—and grow up to be children who were more likely to feel vigilant when meeting new people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1774 - None of these studies is perfect, but the results have consistently suggested that introversion and extroversion, like other major personality traits such as agreeableness and conscientiousness, are about 40 to 50 percent heritable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1820 - public speaking anxiety may be primal and quintessentially human, not limited to those of us born with a high-reactive nervous system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1820 - In fact, public speaking anxiety may be primal and quintessentially human, not limited to those of us born with a high-reactive nervous system. One theory, based on the writings of the sociobiologist E. O. Wilson, holds that when our ancestors lived on the savannah, being watched intently meant only one thing: a wild animal was stalking us.</p>

<p>loc 1820 - In fact, public speaking anxiety may be primal and quintessentially human, not limited to those of us born with a high-reactive nervous system. One theory, based on the writings of the sociobiologist E. O. Wilson, holds that when our ancestors lived on the savannah, being watched intently meant only one thing: a wild animal was stalking us. And when we think we’re about to be eaten, do we stand tall and hold forth confidently? No. We run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1831 - studies do show that introverts are significantly more likely than extroverts to fear public speaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1982 - the footprint of a high- or low-reactive temperament never disappeared in adulthood. Some high-reactives grew into socially fluid teenagers who were not outwardly rattled by novelty, but they never shed their genetic inheritance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1984 - important: we can stretch our personalities, but only up to a point. Our inborn temperaments influence us, regardless</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1984 - Schwartz’s research suggests something important: we can stretch our personalities, but only up to a point. Our inborn temperaments influence us, regardless of the lives we lead. A sizable part of who we are is ordained by our genes, by our brains, by our nervous systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2101 - Once you understand introversion and extroversion as preferences for certain levels of stimulation, you can begin consciously trying to situate yourself in environments favorable to your own personality—neither overstimulating nor understimulating, neither boring nor anxiety-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2137 - Often used as a way to conquer phobias, desensitization involves exposing yourself (and your amygdala) to the thing you’re afraid of over and over again, in manageable doses. This is very different from the well-meaning but unhelpful advice that you should just jump in at the deep end and try to swim—an approach that might work, but more likely will produce panic, further encoding in your brain a cycle of dread, fear, and shame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2182 - Sometimes speakers need to talk about subjects that don’t interest them much, especially at work. I believe this is harder for introverts, who have trouble projecting artificial enthusiasm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2295 - For example, highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee. They have difficulty when being observed (at work, say, or performing at a music recital) or judged for general worthiness (dating, job interviews).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2298 - The highly sensitive tend to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation, rather than materialistic or hedonistic. They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive (just as Aron’s husband had described her). They dream vividly, and can often recall their dreams the next day. They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions—sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2301 - Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2315 - The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they’re highly empathic. It’s as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people’s emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2315 - The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they’re highly empathic. It’s as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people’s emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they’re acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2381 - But the same receptivity to experience that can make life difficult for the highly sensitive also builds their consciences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2392 - High-reactive introverts sweat more; low-reactive extroverts sweat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2502 - human extroverts have more sex partners than introverts do—a boon to any species wanting to reproduce itself—but they commit more adultery and divorce more frequently, which is not a good thing for the children of all those couplings. Extroverts exercise more, but introverts suffer fewer accidents and traumatic injuries. Extroverts enjoy wider networks of social support, but commit more crimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2513 - Suppose a herd of antelope … has a few members who are constantly stopping their grazing to use their keen senses to watch for predators,” she writes. “Herds with such sensitive, watchful individuals would survive better, and so continue to breed, and so continue to have some sensitive individuals born in the group.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2559 - If you’re a sensitive sort, then you may be in the habit of pretending to be more of a politician and less cautious or single-mindedly focused than you actually are. But in this chapter I’m asking you to rethink this view. Without people like you, we will, quite literally, drown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2577 - most settings, people use small talk as a way of relaxing into a new relationship, and only once they’re comfortable do they connect more seriously. Sensitive people seem to do the reverse. They “enjoy small talk only after they’ve gone deep,”</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2681 - just as the amygdala of a high-reactive person is more sensitive than average to novelty, so do extroverts seem to be more susceptible than introverts to the reward-seeking cravings of the old brain. In fact, some scientists are starting to explore the idea that reward-sensitivity is not only an interesting feature of extroversion; it is what makes an extrovert an extrovert</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2692 - extroverts seem to get an extra buzz from the pursuit and attainment of their goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2725 - This blindness to danger may explain why extroverts are more likely than introverts to be killed while driving, be hospitalized as a result of accident or injury, smoke, have risky sex, participate in high-risk sports, have affairs, and remarry. It also helps explain why extroverts are more prone than introverts to overconfidence—defined as greater confidence unmatched by greater ability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2743 - Introverts also seem to be better than extroverts at delaying gratification, a crucial life skill associated with everything from higher SAT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2743 - Introverts also seem to be better than extroverts at delaying gratification, a crucial life skill associated with everything from higher SAT scores and income to lower body mass index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2817 - Introverts seem to be specifically wired or trained so when they catch themselves getting excited and focused on a goal, their vigilance increases.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2838 - Extroverts are more likely to take a quick-and-dirty approach to problem-solving, trading accuracy for speed, making increasing numbers of mistakes as they go, and abandoning ship altogether when the problem seems too difficult or frustrating. Introverts think before they act, digest information thoroughly, stay on task longer, give up less easily, and work more accurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2843 - It’s as if extroverts are seeing “what is” while their introverted peers are asking “what if</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2865 - The point is that we tend to overvalue buzz and discount the risks of reward-sensitivity: we need to find a balance between action and reflection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2925 - So stay true to your own nature. If you like to do things in a slow and steady way, don’t let others make you feel as if you have to race. If you enjoy depth, don’t force yourself to seek breadth. If you prefer single-tasking to multi tasking, stick to your guns. Being relatively unmoved by rewards gives you the incalculable power to go your own way. It’s up to you to use that independence to good effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2933 - Introverts need to trust their gut and share their ideas as powerfully as they can. This does not mean aping extroverts; ideas can be shared quietly, they can be communicated in writing, they can be packaged into highly produced lectures, they can be advanced by allies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3392 - Conviction is conviction, the kids from Cupertino taught me, at whatever decibel level it’s expressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3485 - many people, especially those in leadership roles, engage in a certain level of pretend-extroversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3615 - First, think back to what you loved to do when you were a child. How did you answer the question of what you wanted to be when you grew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3615 - First, think back to what you loved to do when you were a child. How did you answer the question of what you wanted to be when you grew up?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3619 - Second, pay attention to the work you gravitate to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3623 - Finally, pay attention to what you envy. Jealousy is an ugly emotion, but it tells the truth. You mostly envy those who have what you desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3765 - Your degree of extroversion seems to influence how many friends you have, in other words, but not how good a friend you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3767 - They focused on the so-called Big Five traits: Introversion-Extroversion; Agreeableness; Openness to Experience; Conscientiousness; and Emotional Stability. (Many personality psychologists believe that human personality can be boiled down to these five characteristics.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3787 - We all empathize with a sleep-deprived mate who comes home from work too tired to talk, but it’s harder to grasp that social overstimulation can be just as exhausting. It’s also hard for introverts to understand just how hurtful their silence can be.</p>
