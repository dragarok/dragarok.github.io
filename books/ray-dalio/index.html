<p>loc 70 - Without principles we would be forced to react to all the things life throws at us individually, as if we were experiencing each of them for the first time.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 93 - Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2 . . .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 120 - To be a successful entrepreneur, the same is true: One also has to be an independent thinker who correctly bets against the consensus, which means being painfully wrong a fair amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 122 -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 124 - My painful mistakes shifted me from having a perspective of “I know I’m right” to having one of “How do I know I’m right?” They gave me the humility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 131 - Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria whenever I made a decision, so I got in the habit of doing that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 198 - Over the course of our lives, we make millions and millions of decisions that are essentially bets, some large and some small. It pays to think about how we make them because they are what ultimately determine the quality of our lives.</p>
