</li>
<li>
<p>loc 241 - join a club, team, or organization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 602 - Shy people think in ways that increase the supposed risks and stakes of socializing. They see other people as mean and judgmental. They see themselves as unappealing and less socially capable. They view interactions as life-or-death tests of their social skills and worthiness as individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 664 - The self-doubt and inhibition inherent in shyness prevent you from showing your full personality.</p>
</li>

<p>loc 715 - A key to handling anxiety is to break the avoidance habit.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 871 - You may have been born with a tendency to be more anxious and insecure than average, and it’s something you’ll have to learn to work around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 873 - Accepting that you may sometimes get uncomfortable in social situations takes away some of the control your shyness and insecurities have over you.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 913 - Caring less about your social faux pas is easier said than done. The secret is to make acting against your worries a higher priority than trying to make every interaction go perfectly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 918 - Be pleasant and understanding toward your fears and insecurities.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1022 - When you overstate how something really is, once again with iffy evidence to back up your thinking, you magnify the situation; similarly, if you understate a situation with insufficient evidence, you minimize it.</p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1391 - You can learn to simply observe these thoughts and choose not to take them at face value or act on them. You don’t need to debate or break them down. That would give them too much credit and power. Instead, you can briefly note them in a distant, nonjudgmental way and then let them pass.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 2649 - Some people are too quick to give up on a conversation when it turns to an area they don’t have in common with the other person. Once you get your lack of familiarity about the topic out in the open, you’ll often find a way to get the interaction going again.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2886 - Give a good, full response to whatever their opening question or statement is. Even if it’s something you’ve heard a lot and are a bit bored to talk about, still give a proper, amiable reply. Possibly end your reply by asking a question of your own.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3030 - Safe, surface-level topics include your job and education; your living situation; your hobbies and interests; your noncontroversial observations, opinions, and humor, who you’re friends with; your family makeup; and your goals and plans for the future.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3092 - When you reveal your vulnerabilities and rough edges, you seem endearingly human. When you act like you have no flaws, you become distant and unrelatable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3113 - A common complaint from more intellectual types is that they have a hard time getting people to have these kinds of interesting, meaningful conversations.

</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>loc 4258 - In general, you should make more eye contact when you’re listening, which is easier to do. When you’re speaking, it’s okay to look away more, which often happens naturally as you get distracted by trying to put together what you want to say.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 6110 - Get what you can from your job or existing contacts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 6125 - Do more activities outside of the house. Find a way to use your existing hobbies to put you in contact with more people.

</li>
<li>

<p>loc 6386 - Studies have shown that lonely people tend to be more negative about others in general. Although people with this problem may be somewhat choosy to begin with, the trait is mainly a side effect of loneliness.
