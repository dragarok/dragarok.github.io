<p>loc 527 - Rana sylvatica also stops breathing and has no heartbeat for days at a time.</p>

<p>loc 615 - linear superposition to the certainty of one outcome</p>

<p>loc 736 - It takes over 16,000 years for the light from the furthest star visible with the naked eye, V762 Cas in the constellation of Cassiopeia, to reach us.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 805 - As they merged, briefly there is a power output five hundred times greater than all the stars in the known universe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 918 - The stretch of space stretches the light, which increases its wavelength.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 995 - The solution to this problem is known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis; most of the helium and all the deuterium in the Universe was constructed in the first few minutes in the life of the Universe, when conditions were hot enough for nuclear fusion to occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1024 - The calculations agree with observation if the baryon to photon ratio is 6 x 10-10; i.e. around 1 baryon for every billion photons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1031 - We know the photon density in the Universe today very precisely from our measurements of the CMB, because it is directly related to the temperature of the CMB; there are 413 photons per cubic centimetre</p>

<li>
<p>loc 1047 - The rest of the mass appears to be dark, and to interact very weakly with the stars, gas and dust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1075 - We now have our inventory of the Universe. There are 0.25 baryons (protons and neutrons) per cubic metre, 1.25 dark matter particles per cubic metre, and 3.5 baryons’ worth of dark energy per cubic metre, adding up to a total matter and energy content of the Universe of 5 baryons’ worth per cubic metre today.</p>

<p>loc 1219 - The critical density is the density of matter and energy required to make the Universe ‘flat’. If</p>

<li>
<p>loc 1287 - Changing the relative strengths of the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces can result in very different nuclear physics, which can lead to a universe devoid of large quantities of carbon and oxygen, and therefore unlikely to support life.</p>
