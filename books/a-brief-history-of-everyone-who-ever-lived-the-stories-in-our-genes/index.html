                <p>### Author: Rutherford, Adam</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 1 - Here two sets of multiplexers select register which perform input data for ALU. A decoder selects destination register by enabling its load input. The function select in ALU determines the particular operation that to be performed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1 - For an example to perform the operation: R3  R1 + R2 1. MUX A selector (SELA): to place the content of R1 into bus A.2. MUX B selector (SELB): to place the content of R2 into bus B.3. ALU operation selector (OPR): to provide arithmetic addition A + B.4. Decoder destination selector (SELD): to transfer the content of the output bus into R3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2 - If it is a hardwired, register decodes and a set of gates are connected to provide the logic that determines the action required to execute various instructions. A</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2 - micro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2 - micro-programmed control unit uses a control memory to store micro instructions and a sequence to determine the order by which the instructions are read from control memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2 - It can be characterized on the basis of design and implementation by:  Defining basic elements of the processor  Describing the micro-operation that processor performs  Determining the function that the control unit must perform to cause the micro-operations to be performed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2 - Flag: flags are headed to determine the status of processor and outcome of previous ALU operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3 - Control signal from control bus: The control bus portion of system bus provides interrupt, acknowledgement signals to control unit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4 - -Visible Registers - enable the machine- or assembly-language programmer to minimize main-memory references by optimizing use of registers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4 - Control and Status Registers - used by the control unit to control the operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5 - of the CPU and by privileged, OS programs to control the execution of programs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5 - User-Visible Registers Categories of Use - General Purpose registers - for variety of functions - Data registers - hold data - Address registers - hold address information - Segment pointers - hold base address of the segment in use - Index registers - used for indexed addressing and may be auto indexed - Stack Pointer - a dedicated register that points to top of a stack.Push, pop, and other stack instructions need not contain an explicit stack operand. - Condition Codes (flags)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5 - Supervisor - indicates if privileged ops can be used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 8 - We can indicate sequence in general terms, assuming CPU employs:  a memory address register (MAR)  a memory buffer register (MBR)  a program counter (PC)  an instruction register (IR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 8 - Indirect cycle data flow - Decodes the instruction - After fetch, control unit examines IR to see if indirect addressing is being used. If so: - Rightmost n bits of MBR (the memory reference) are transferred to MAR - Control unit requests a memory read, to get the desired operand address into the MBR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 14 - The instruction in a stack computer consists of an operation code with no address field. This operation has the effect of popping the 2 top numbers from the stack, operating the numbers and pushing the sum into the stack. For example: ADD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 14 - Format: Op X, Y, Z; X  Y Op</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 14 - The three address instruction format requires a very complex design to hold the three address references</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 15 - Example: ADD X, Y, Z; X  Y + Z  ADVANTAGE: It results in short programs when evaluating arithmetic expressions.  DISADVANTAGE: The instructions requires too many bits to specify 3 addresses.Two address instruction 2. Two-address instructions are the most common in commercial computers. Here again each address field can specify either a processor register, or a memory word. One address must do double duty as both operand and result. The two address instruction format reduces the space requirement. To avoid altering the value of an operand, a MOV instruction is used to move one of the values to a result or temporary location T, before performing the operation.Format: Op X, Y; X  X Op Y Example: SUB X, Y; X  X - Y 3. One address Instruction It was generally used in earlier machine with the implied address been a CPU register known as accumulator. The accumulator contains one of the operand and is used to store the result.One-address instruction uses an implied accumulator (Ac) register for all data manipulation. All operations are done between the AC register and a memory operand. We use LOAD and STORE instruction for transfer to and from memory and Ac register.Format: Op X; Ac  Ac Op X Example: MUL X; Ac  Ac * X 4. Zero address Instruction It does not use address field for the instruction like ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV etc. The PUSH and POP instructions, however, need an address field to specify the operand that communicates with the stack. The name “Zero” address is given because of the absence of an address field in the computational instruction.Format: Op; TOS  TOS Op (TOS – 1) Example: DIV; TOS  TOS DIV (TOS – 1) Example: To illustrate the influence of the number of address on computer programs, we will evaluate the arithmetic statement X=(A+B)*(C+D) using Zero, one, two, or three address instructions.1.Three-Address Instructions: ADD R1, A, B; R1  M[A] + M[B] ADD R2, C, D; R2  M[C] + M[D] MUL X, R1,R2; M<input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox">  R1 * R2 It is assumed that the computer has two processor registers R1 and R2. The symbol M[A] denotes the operand at memory address symbolized by A.2.Two-Address Instructions: MOV R1, A; R1  M[A] ADD R1, B; R1  R1 + M[B]Compiled By: Er.

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 17 - It was mentioned previously that the address field of an instruction may specify either a memory word or a processor register. When the address field specifies a processor register, the instruction is said to be in register-mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 24 - An interrupt procedure usually stores all the information necessary to define the state of the CPU rather than storing only the program counter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 24 - One reason for the trend to provide a complex instruction set is the desire to simplify the compilation and improve the overall computer performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 25 - Small set of instructions – mostly register to register operations and simple load/store operations for memory access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 27 - Some computers provide multiple-register banks, and each procedure is allocated its own bank of registers. This eliminates the need for saving and restoring register</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 29 - Microprocessor initiated operations mainly deal with memory and I/O read and write operations.  Internal operations determines how and what operations can be performed with the data.The operations include: 1. storing 2. performing arithmetic and logical operations 3. test for conditions</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 29 - The various function performed by the microprocessor can be classified as: o Microprocessor initiated operations o Internal operations o Peripheral operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 29 - External initiated operations are initiated by the external devices to perform special operations like reset, interrupt, ready, etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 31 - 64-bit processors can drive 32-bit applications even faster, by handling more data per clock cycle than a 32-bit processor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 60 - Despite our differences, all humans are remarkably close relatives, and our family tree is pollarded, and tortuous, and not in the slightest bit like a tree. But we are the fruit thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 98 - You carry an epic poem in your cells. It’s an incomparable, sprawling, unique, meandering saga.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 216 - Life is transition: the only things that are truly static are already dead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2599 - To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2833 - welcome order, but it will be an order imposed</p>
</li>
