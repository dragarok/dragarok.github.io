<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 70 - Don’t pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 89 - It’s not that distributors were evil. It was just an awful system, and I wanted nothing to do with it. So when the big online record stores told me they couldn’t sell my CD directly, I thought, “Ah, screw it. I’ll just set up my own online store. How hard could it be?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 116 - When you make a business, you get to make a little universe where you control all the laws. This is your utopia. When you make it a dream come true for yourself, it’ll be a dream come true for someone else, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 126 - setup fee per album and a $4 cut per CD sold. A business plan should never take more than a few hours of work—hopefully no more than a few minutes. The best plans start simple. A quick glance and common sense should tell you if the numbers will work. The rest are details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 127 - work—hopefully no more than a few minutes. The best plans start simple. A quick glance and common sense should tell you if the numbers will work. The rest are details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 134 - If you think revolution needs to feel like war, you’ll overlook the importance of simply serving people better. When you’re onto something great, it won’t feel like revolution. It’ll feel like uncommon sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 135 - When you’re onto something great, it won’t feel like revolution. It’ll feel like uncommon sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 151 - You can use this same rule on yourself if you’re often overcommitted or too scattered. If you’re not saying, “Hell yeah!” about something, say no. When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” then say no.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 154 - For every event you get invited to, every request to start a new project, if you’re not saying, “Hell yeah!” about it, say no.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 166 - Anytime you think you know what your new business will be doing, remember this quote from serial entrepreneur Steve Blank: “No business plan survives first contact with customers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 174 - I’m so glad I didn’t have investors. I didn’t have to please anybody but my customers and myself. No effort was spent on anything but my customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 177 - By not having any money to waste, you never waste money. Since I couldn’t afford a programmer, I went to the bookstore and got a $25 book on PHP and MySQL programming. Then I sat down and learned it, with no programming experience. Necessity is a great teacher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 183 - If you’re ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 222 - I don’t want to hear people’s ideas. I’m not interested until I see their execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 230 - After CD Baby grew to fifty employees, all the business-to-business service companies started pitching me on how I needed an official employee review plan, sensitivity training, Terms and Conditions postings, and all this corporate crap. I got such joy out of saying no to all of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 253 - When you build your business on serving thousands of customers, not dozens, you don’t have to worry about any one customer leaving or making special demands. If most of your customers love what you do, but one doesn’t, you can just say good-bye and wish him the best, with no hard feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 266 - It’s a big world. You can loudly leave out 99 percent of it. Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 274 - When you’ve asked your customers what would improve your service, has anyone said, “Please fill your website with more advertising”? Nope. So don’t do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 289 - “OK, make a plan that requires only $1,000. Go!” “Now make a plan for ten times as many customers. Go!” “Now do it without a website. Go!” “Now make all your initial assumptions wrong, and have it work anyway. Go!” “Now show how you would franchise it. Go!” You can’t pretend there’s only one way to do it. Your first idea is just one of many options. No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans.</p>

Your first idea is just one of many options. No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans. Same thing with your current path in life: Now you’re living in New York City, obsessed with success. Go! Now you’re a free spirit, backpacking around Thailand. Go! Now you’re a confident extrovert and everyone loves you. Go! Now you’re married and your kids are your life. Go! Now you spend a few years in relative seclusion, reading and walking. Go!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 310 - Journalists would ask, “What’s your long-term goal for CD Baby?” I’d say, “I don’t have one. I surpassed my goals long ago. I’m just trying to help musicians with whatever they need today.” So please don’t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 316 - “When the mafia ran this town, it was fun. There were only two numbers that mattered: how much was coming in, and how much was going out. As long as there was more in than out, everyone was happy. But then the whole town was bought up by these damn corporations full of MBA weasels micromanaging, trying to maximize the profit from every square foot of floor space. Now the place that used to put ketchup on my hot dog tells me it’ll be an extra twenty-five cents for ketchup! It sucked all the fun out of this town!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 335 - For me, it’s how many useful things I create, whether songs, companies, articles, websites, or anything else. If I create something that’s not useful to others, it doesn’t count. But I’m also not interested in doing something useful unless it needs my creative input. How do you grade yourself?</p>
