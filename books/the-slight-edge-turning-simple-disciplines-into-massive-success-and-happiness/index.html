<p>loc 373 - The things that take you out of failure and up toward survival and success are simple. So simple, in fact, that it’s easy to overlook them. Extremely easy to overlook them. It’s easy to overlook them because when you look at them, they seem insignificant. They’re not big, sweeping things that take huge effort. They’re not heroic or dramatic. Mostly they’re just little things you do every day and that nobody else even notices. They are things that are so simple to do—yet successful people actually do them, while unsuccessful people only look at them and don’t take action.</p>

Mostly they’re just little things you do every day and that nobody else even notices. They are things that are so simple to do—yet successful people actually do them, while unsuccessful people only look at them and don’t take action. Things like taking a few dollars out of a paycheck, putting it into savings, and leaving it there. Or doing a few minutes of exercise every day—and not skipping it. Or reading ten pages of an inspiring, educational, life-changing book every day. Or taking a moment to tell someone how much you appreciate them, and doing that consistently, every day, for months and years. Little things that seem insignificant in the doing, yet when compounded over time yield very big results.</p>

Or reading ten pages of an inspiring, educational, life-changing book every day. Or taking a moment to tell someone how much you appreciate them, and doing that consistently, every day, for months and years. Little things that seem insignificant in the doing, yet when compounded over time yield very big results. You could call these “little virtues” or “success habits.” I call them simple daily disciplines. Simple productive actions, repeated consistently over time. That, in a nutshell, is the slight edge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 498 - If you don’t change how you think about these simple everyday things, then no amount of how-to’s will get you anywhere or give you any true solutions. Because it’s not the hows that do it, it’s how you do the hows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 523 - Here is an example of a life philosophy; it comes from Ralph Waldo Emerson in his Essay on Compensation: Do the thing, and you shall have the power. Profoundly simple and just as powerful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 532 - Your philosophy is what you know, how you hold what you know, and how it affects what you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 534 - Here’s another example of a life philosophy, this one from Thomas J. Watson, the founder of IBM: The formula for success is quite simple: Double your rate of failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 552 - Your philosophy is your view of life, something beyond feelings and attitudes. Your philosophy drives your attitudes and feelings, which drive your actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 610 - No matter how good the information is, it won’t do you any good unless you have the right catalyst that will let you apply it effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 614 - Successful people fail their way to the top. Do the thing, and you shall have the power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 866 - slight edge is relentless and cuts both ways: simple daily disciplines or simple errors in judgment, repeated consistently over time, make you or break you.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 942 - Despite the fact that he didn’t seem to have any special skills or talent for performing and was absolutely no good at being on stage, he set about doing it anyway. Hour after hour, day after day, he studied magic tricks, taught himself the banjo, tried out lines on anyone who would listen (and quite a few who wouldn’t), and worked at turning his quirky sense of humor into bits that would hopefully not completely fall flat in front of an audience. He did that for years, with little evidence (at least not at first) that he was really getting anywhere. And fifteen years later, Steve Martin was the single biggest audience draw in the history of standup comedy.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 953 - That is the difference between the 5 percent and everyone else. They know how to use the slight edge to get what they want in life. No, let’s amend that slightly: they know how to use the slight edge to get what they want in life—and they do it. They do the thing, and gain the power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1029 - That’s the choice you face every day, every hour: A simple, positive action, repeated over time. A simple error in judgment, repeated over time. So easy to do. So easy not to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1078 - The difference between success and failure is not dramatic. In fact, the difference between success and failure is so subtle, so mundane, that most people miss it.</p>
