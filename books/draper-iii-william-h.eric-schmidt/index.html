<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 220 - stage in the company’s development. Not that it’s easy. It’s almost never simple to find the right fit between a visionary and a potential manager of that vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 244 - Why recount at some length the story of “one that got away”? After all, each of the three generations of Drapers has stories to tell about the ones that didn’t get away. Why not focus on those? It’s because I think the Yahoo story contains a lot of the elements of real-life venture capital, which is part of what this book is about.</p>

<p>loc 244 - Why recount at some length the story of “one that got away”? After all, each of the three generations of Drapers has stories to tell about the ones that didn’t get away. Why not focus on those? It’s because I think the Yahoo story contains a lot of the elements of real-life venture capital, which is part of what this book is about. It conveys something of the love that great entrepreneurs put into their product or service. It captures a lot of the pain, joy, suspense, frustration, and elation that we venture capitalists feel as we’re closing—or failing to close—a deal. It underscores the fundamental fact that in venture capital, you’re going to win some, and you’re going to lose some.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 258 - When people ask me whether venture capitalists are born or self-made, I tend to waffle. I suspect it’s a little bit of both, with definite shading toward the self-made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 268 - This brings us to an important lesson about venture capital: don’t invest any money that you can’t afford to lose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 293 - Why is the coffeemaker story so vivid in my memory? Because he told it to me many times and drove the message home. He wanted me to take away lessons from this misadventure, including the need to spread the risk, to always save something for a rainy day, and to work hard enough to make good things happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 358 - The median, annual family income in Atherton, California—the little town twenty-eight miles south of San Francisco where we would eventually settle—was $3,857 in 1950. By the year 2000, it would exceed $200,000. By the beginning of the new millennium, Atherton was one of the most affluent locations on the planet.3 It was Silicon Valley that made that possible, and it was venture capital that helped make Silicon Valley possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 483 - not to be “mesmerized by the gold watch as it swings back and forth in the hand of the hypnotic and captivating fast-talking magician”—in other words, the entrepreneur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 493 - the partners, associates, and “over the transom.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 747 - Luck is clearly a big factor in life, but I would advise any young person interested in becoming a venture capitalist or an entrepreneur not to be overly fatalistic. Work hard, work smart, and luck happens. Each of us has unique qualities and characteristics, and the trick is to play to one’s own strengths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 751 - The big secret in life is that there is no big secret. Whatever your goal, you can get there if you’re willing to work. —Oprah Winfrey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 784 - The limited partners put in the money, and the general partners do the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 795 - For tax reasons, the general partners must invest as limited partners at least 1 percent of the total money raised for any given fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 801 - Sutter Hill was set up, and today continues to operate, as an “evergreen partnership.” What does that mean? Rather than asking the limited partners to invest in separate funds (e.g., Funds I, II, and III, each of which has a limited life of, say, ten years), Sutter Hill values the whole portfolio every four years and allows the limited partner to take its money out at that time—either in the form of cash or of its share of each stock in the portfolio. When I left Sutter Hill in 1981 to join the Reagan administration, for example, I took my share of each stock and later became a limited partner.</p>
