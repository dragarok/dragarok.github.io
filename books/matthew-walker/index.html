<li>
<p>loc 98 - Theories ranged from the logical (a time for conserving energy), to the peculiar (an opportunity for eyeball oxygenation), to the psychoanalytic (a non-conscious state in which we fulfill repressed wishes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 281 - twenty-four-hour biological clock sitting in the middle of your brain is called the suprachiasmatic (pronounced soo-pra-kai-as-MAT-ik) nucleus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 286 - The suprachiasmatic nucleus uses this reliable light information to reset its inherent time inaccuracy to a crisp twenty-four-hour cycle, preventing any drift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 346 - Your suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of night and day to your brain and body using a circulating messenger called melatonin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 353 - melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself: a mistaken assumption that many people hold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 388 - This is jet lag: you feel tired and sleepy during the day in the new time zone because your body clock and associated biology still “think” it is nighttime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 405 - Two alarming results have emerged. First, parts of their brains—specifically those related to learning and memory—had physically shrunk, suggesting the destruction of brain</p>

<li>
<p>loc 405 - Scientists have studied airplane cabin crews who frequently fly on long-haul routes and have little chance to recover. Two alarming results have emerged. First, parts of their brains—specifically those related to learning and memory—had physically shrunk, suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of time-zone travel. Second,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 430 - caffeine is the most widely used (and abused) psychoactive stimulant in the world. It is the second most traded commodity on the planet,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 440 - Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours. Let’s say that you have a cup of coffee after your evening dinner, around 7:30 p.m. This means that by 1:30 a.m., 50 percent of that caffeine may still be active and circulating throughout your brain tissue. In other words, by 1:30 a.m., you’re only halfway to completing the job of cleansing your brain of the caffeine you drank after dinner. There’s nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 451 - Should you drink three to four cups of decaf in the evening, it is just as damaging to your sleep as one regular cup of coffee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 460 - If you are trying to stay awake late into the night by drinking coffee, you should be prepared for a nasty consequence when your liver successfully evicts the caffeine from your system: a phenomenon commonly known as a “caffeine crash.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 491 - Adenosine creates a pressure to sleep, also known as Process-S. Represented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 635 - At the most obvious level, you lose your conscious sense of time when you sleep, tantamount to a chronometric void.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 644 - One last temporal distortion deserves mention here—that of time dilation in dreams, beyond sleep itself. Time isn’t quite time within dreams. It is most often elongated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 655 - The first striking result was that the signature pattern of brain-cell firing that occurred as the rats were learning the maze subsequently reappeared during sleep, over and over again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 657 - During REM sleep, the memories were being replayed far more slowly: at just half or quarter the speed of that measured when the rats were awake and learning the maze.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 662 - scientific verification of sleep requires the recording of signals, using electrodes, arising from three different regions: (1) brainwave activity, (2) eye movement activity, and (3) muscle activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 676 - humans don’t just sleep, but cycle through two completely different types of sleep. They named these sleep stages based on their defining ocular features: non–rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep, and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 681 - NREM stages 1 to 4 (we sleep researchers are a creative bunch), increasing in their depth. Stages 3 and 4 are therefore the deepest stages of NREM sleep you experience, with “depth” being defined as the increasing difficulty required to wake an individual out of NREM stages 3 and 4, compared with NREM stages 1 or 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 688 - ebb and flow across the night reveals the quite beautiful cycling architecture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 808 - By severing perceptual ties with the outside world, not only do we lose our sense of consciousness (explaining why we do not dream in deep NREM sleep, nor do we keep explicit track of time), this also allows the cortex to “relax” into its default mode of functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 824 - As your brain shifts from the fast-frequency activity of waking to the slower, more measured pattern of deep NREM sleep, the very same long-range communication advantage becomes possible. The steady, slow, synchronous waves that sweep across the brain during deep sleep open up communication possibilities between distant regions of the brain, allowing them to collaboratively send and receive their different repositories of stored experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 837 - Indeed, recent MRI scanning studies have found that there are individual parts of the brain that are up to 30 percent more active during REM sleep than when we are awake!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 846 - Rather, signals of emotions, motivations, and memories (past and present) are all played out on the big screens of our visual, auditory, and kinesthetic sensory cortices in the brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 848 - When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as reception (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as reflection (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as integration (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 861 - This feature, termed “atonia” (an absence of tone, referring here to the muscles), is instigated by a powerful disabling signal that is transmitted down the full length of your spinal cord from your brain stem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 891 - III. Oddly, during the transition from being awake into light stage 1 NREM sleep, the eyes will gently and very, very slowly start to roll in their sockets in synchrony, like two ocular ballerinas pirouetting in perfect time with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1066 - The more nights an individual sleeps in the new location, the more similar the sleep is in each half of the brain. It is perhaps the reason why so many of us sleep so poorly the first night in a hotel room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1091 - These ultra–power naps are just sufficient to avert the ruinous brain and body deficits that would otherwise ensue from prolonged total sleep deprivation. (If you’re wondering, humans have no such similar ability.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1093 - The white-crowned sparrow is perhaps the most astonishing example of avian sleep deprivation during long-distance flights. This small, quotidian bird is capable of a spectacular feat that the American military has spent millions of research dollars studying. The sparrow has an unparalleled, though time-limited, resilience to total sleep deprivation, one that we humans could never withstand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1255 - REM-sleep dreaming therefore represents a tenable new contributing factor, among others, that led to our astonishingly rapid evolutionary rise to power, for better and worse—a new (sleep-fueled), globally dominant social superclass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1269 - Prior to birth, a human infant will spend almost all of its time in a sleep-like state, much of which resembles the REM-sleep state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1284 - In the last two weeks of pregnancy, the fetus will ramp up its consumption of REM sleep to almost nine hours a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1284 - In the last two weeks of pregnancy, the fetus will ramp up its consumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1284 - In the last two weeks of pregnancy, the fetus will ramp up its consumption of REM sleep to almost nine hours a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1291 - The brain, like the roof of a house, is one of the last items to be constructed during development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1293 - Detailed creation of the brain and its component parts occurs at a rapid pace during the second and third trimesters of human development—precisely the time window when REM-sleep amounts skyrocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1296 - Think of REM sleep like an Internet service provider that populates new neighborhoods of the brain with vast networks of fiber-optic cables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1298 - This phase of development, which infuses the brain with masses of neural connections, is called synaptogenesis, as it involves the creation of millions of wiring links, or synapses, between neurons. By deliberate design, it is an overenthusiastic first pass at setting up the mainframe of a brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1311 - Day after day, the half-finished roofline of the sleep-starved cerebral cortex shows no growth change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1314 - An infant brain without sleep will be a brain ever underconstructed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1315 - A more recent link with deficient REM sleep concerns autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1323 - The circadian rhythms of autistic children are also weaker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1323 - The circadian rhythms of autistic children are also weaker than their non-autistic counterparts, showing a flatter profile of melatonin across the twenty-four-hour period rather than a powerful rise in concentration at night and rapid fall throughout the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1342 - Alcohol consumed by a mother readily crosses the placental barrier, and therefore readily infuses her developing fetus. Knowing this, scientists first examined the extreme scenario: mothers who were alcoholics or heavy drinkers during pregnancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1361 - Furthermore, these unborn infants suffered a marked depression in breathing during REM sleep, with breath rates dropping from a normal rate of 381 per hour during natural sleep to just 4 per hour when the fetus was awash with alcohol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1367 - Newborns will normally transition straight into REM sleep after a feeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1399 - By four years of age, the circadian rhythm is in dominant command of a child’s sleep behavior, with a lengthy slab of nighttime sleep, usually supplemented by just a single daytime nap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1405 - During the fourteen hours of total shut-eye per day that a six-month-old infant obtains, there is a 50/50 timeshare between NREM and REM sleep. A five-year-old, however, will have a 70/30 split between NREM and REM sleep across the eleven hours of total daily slumber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1418 - But since this first round of brain wiring is purposefully overzealous, a second round of remodeling must take place. It does so during late childhood and adolescence. Here, the architectural goal is not to scale up, but to scale back for the goal of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1437 - Of the many functions carried out by deep NREM sleep—the full roster of which we will discuss in the next chapter—it is that of synaptic pruning that features prominently during adolescence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1450 - Feinberg began seeing a sharp rise in deep-sleep intensity in his electrical recordings, right at the time when the developmental needs of brain connectivity switch from growing connections to shedding them;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1451 - the tree’s equivalent of fall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1456 - As deep NREM sleep performs its final overhaul and refinement of the brain during adolescence, cognitive skills, reasoning, and critical thinking start to improve, and do so</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1456 - As deep NREM sleep performs its final overhaul and refinement of the brain during adolescence, cognitive skills, reasoning, and critical thinking start to improve, and do so in a proportional manner with that NREM sleep change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1458 - The changes in deep NREM sleep always precede the cognitive and developmental milestones within the brain by several weeks or months, implying a direction of influence: deep sleep may be a driving force of brain maturation, not the other way around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1464 - Therefore, the back of the brain of an adolescent was more adult-like, while the front of the brain remained more child-like at any one moment during this developmental window of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1469 - It takes deep sleep, and developmental time, to accomplish the neural maturation that plugs this brain “gap” within the frontal lobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1477 - Of concern is that administering caffeine to juvenile rats will also disrupt deep NREM sleep and, as a consequence, delay numerous measures of brain maturation and the development of social activity, independent grooming, and the exploration of the environment—measures of self-motivated learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1537 - And the time of day when those independent adolescent wings unfold, and the first solo flights from the parental nest occur, is not a time of day at all, but rather a time of night, thanks to a forward-shifted circadian rhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1559 - Certainly, when we sleep at night, and even when we wake in the morning, most of us do not have a good sense of our electrical sleep quality. Frequently this means that many seniors progress through their later years not fully realizing how degraded their deep-sleep quantity and quality have become.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1621 - am not, however, suggesting that older adults stop exercising in the morning. Exercise can help solidify good sleep, especially in the elderly. Instead, I advise two modifications for seniors. First, wear sunglasses during morning exercise outdoors. This will reduce the influence of morning light being sent to your suprachiasmatic clock that would otherwise keep you on an early-to-rise schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1624 - Second, go back outside in the late afternoon for sunlight exposure, but this time do not wear sunglasses. Make sure to wear sun protection of some sort, such as a hat, but leave the sunglasses at home. Plentiful later-afternoon daylight will help delay the evening release of melatonin, helping push the timing of sleep to a later hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1642 - First, the areas of the brain that suffer the most dramatic deterioration with aging are, unfortunately, the very same deep-sleep-generating regions—the middle-frontal regions seated above the bridge of the nose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1648 - was a saddening confirmation of my theory: the parts of our brain that ignite healthy deep sleep at night are the very same areas that degenerate, or atrophy, earliest and most severely as we age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1661 - Recently, we identified one factor—a sticky, toxic protein that builds up in the brain called beta-amyloid that is a key cause of Alzheimer’s disease: a discovery discussed in the next several chapters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1720 - Each stage of sleep—light NREM sleep, deep NREM sleep, and REM sleep—offer different brain benefits at different times of night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1749 - The memory refreshment was related to lighter, stage 2 NREM sleep, and specifically the short, powerful bursts of electrical activity called sleep spindles,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1750 - The more sleep spindles an individual obtained during the nap, the greater the restoration of their learning when they woke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1771 - Of broader societal relevance, the concentration of NREM-sleep spindles is especially rich in the late-morning hours, sandwiched between long periods of REM sleep. Sleep six hours or less and you are shortchanging the brain of a learning restoration benefit that is normally performed by sleep spindles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1879 - Nevertheless, the findings offer a scientific explanation for the ancient practice of rocking a child back and forth in one’s arms, or in a crib, inducing a deep sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1936 - sleep does not offer a general, nonspecific (and hence verbose) preservation of all the information you learn during the day. Instead, sleep is able to offer a far more discerning hand in memory improvement: one that preferentially picks and chooses what information is, and is not, ultimately strengthened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1953 - The idea may invoke the premise of the Oscar-winning movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, in which individuals can have unwanted memories deleted by a special brain-scanning machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1963 - The term “muscle memory” is a misnomer. Muscles themselves have no such memory: a muscle that is not connected to a brain cannot perform any skilled actions, nor does a muscle store skilled routines. Muscle memory is, in fact, brain memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1990 - The findings also shed light on how the brain, after injury or damage by a stroke, gradually regains some ability to guide skill movements day by day—or should I say, night by night. By that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1990 - The findings also shed light on how the brain, after injury or damage by a stroke, gradually regains some ability to guide skill movements day by day—or should I say, night by night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2025 - Rather than a transfer from short- to long-term memory required for saving facts, the motor memories had been shifted over to brain circuits that operate below the level of consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2030 - The increases in speed and accuracy, underpinned by efficient automaticity, were directly related to the amount of stage 2 NREM, especially</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2129 - During a microsleep, your brain becomes blind to the outside world for a brief moment—and not just the visual domain, but in all channels of perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2133 - A two-second microsleep at 30 mph with a modest angle of drift can result in your vehicle transitioning entirely from one lane to the next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2136 - What is the recycle rate of a human being? That is, how long can a human go without sleep before their performance is objectively impaired?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2309 - Give them hours and hours of sleep opportunity in the laboratory, with no alarms or wake-up calls, and still they naturally sleep this short amount and no more. Part of the explanation appears to lie in their genetics, specifically a sub-variant of a gene called BHLHE41.III</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2334 - amygdala—a key hot spot for triggering strong emotions such as anger and rage, and linked to the fight-or-flight response—showed well over a 60 percent amplification in emotional reactivity in the participants who were sleep-deprived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2343 - With a full night of plentiful sleep, we have a balanced mix between our emotional gas pedal (amygdala) and brake (prefrontal cortex).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2358 - Insufficient sleep does not, therefore, push the brain into a negative mood state and hold it there. Rather, the under-slept brain swings excessively to both extremes of emotional valence, positive and negative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2418 - Major depression has as much to do with absence of positive emotions, a feature described as anhedonia: the inability to gain pleasure from normally pleasurable experiences, such as food, socializing, or sex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2462 - You may have seen a movie called Memento, in which the lead character suffers brain damage and, from that point forward, can no longer make any new memories. In neurology, he is what we call “densely amnesic.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2475 - The very latest work in this area has revealed that sleep deprivation even impacts the DNA and the learning-related genes in the brain cells of the hippocampus itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2489 - As many have said about such stoic institutions: theories, beliefs, and practices die one generation at a time. But the conversation and battle must start somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3133 - In fact, there are four main clusters of the brain that spike in activity when someone starts dreaming in REM sleep: (1) the visuospatial regions at the back of the brain, which enable complex visual perception; (2) the motor cortex, which instigates movement; (3) the hippocampus and surrounding regions that we have spoken about before, which support your autobiographical memory; and (4) the deep emotional centers of the brain—the amygdala and the cingulate cortex, a ribbon of tissue that sits above the amygdala and lines the inner surface of your brain—both of which help generate and process emotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3151 - Coarse and rudimentary as the method was, we entered a new era of understanding the why and the how of REM-sleep dreaming, without relying on idiosyncratic rules or opaque explanations of past dream theories, such as Freud’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3180 - The scientists were able to predict with significant accuracy the content of participants’ dreams at any one moment in time using just the MRI scans, operating completely blind to the dream reports of the participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3193 - There may well be a time in the not-too-distant future where we can accurately “read out” and thus take ownership of a process that few people have volitional control over—the dream.I When this finally happens, and I’m sure it will, do we hold the dreamer responsible for what they dream? Is it fair to judge what it is they are dreaming, since they were not the conscious architect of their dream? But if they were not, then who is? It is a perplexing and uncomfortable issue to face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3210 - Freud had single-handedly wrested dreams from the ownership of celestial beings, and from the anatomically unclear location of the soul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3220 - Freud believed that he understood how the censor worked and that, as a result, he could decrypt the disguised dream (manifest content) and reverse-engineer it to reveal the true meaning (latent content, rather like email encryption wherein the message is cloaked with a code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3252 - The exercise, however, importantly reveals the dangers of generic interpretations that feel very personal and uniquely individual, yet scientifically hold no specificity whatsoever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3305 - it may also produce this thing we call dreaming. Dreams, like heat from a lightbulb, may serve no function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3308 - To address this stalemate, exploring whether dreaming, beyond the stage of sleep it emerges from, has true purpose, scientists began by defining the functions of REM sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3318 - The first function involves nursing our emotional and mental health, and is the focus of this chapter. The second is problem solving and creativity, the power of which some individuals try to harness more fully by controlling their dreams, which we treat in the next chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3329 - Noradrenaline, also known as norepinephrine, is the brain equivalent to a body chemical you already know and have felt the effects of: adrenaline (epinephrine).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3350 - Indeed, I argued that if REM sleep did not perform this operation, we’d all be left with a state of chronic anxiety in our autobiographical memory networks; every time we recalled something salient, not only would we recall the details of the memory, but we would relive the same stressful emotional charge all over again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3363 - In addition, results of the MRI scans showed a large and significant reduction in reactivity in the amygdala, that emotional center of the brain that creates painful feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3388 - Her patients required REM sleep with dreaming, but dreaming of a very specific kind: that which expressly involved dreaming about the emotional themes and sentiments of the waking trauma. It was only that content-specific form of dreaming that was able to accomplish clinical remission and offer emotional closure in these patients, allowing them to move forward into a new emotional</p>

It was only that content-specific form of dreaming that was able to accomplish clinical remission and offer emotional closure in these patients, allowing them to move forward into a new emotional future, and not be enslaved by a traumatic past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3402 - There was also evidence suggesting that PTSD patients had higher-than-normal levels of noradrenaline released by their nervous system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3421 - In his PTSD clinic, Raskind had been treating his war veteran patients with a generic drug called prazosin to manage their high blood pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3434 - These were hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck-standing-up conversations, perhaps the most exciting I have ever experienced in my career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3448 - There are regions of your brain whose job it is to read and decode the value and meaning of emotional signals, especially faces. And it is that very same essential set of brain regions, or network, that REM sleep recalibrates at night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3453 - Like viewing an image through frosted glass, or looking at an out-of-focus picture, a dream-starved brain cannot accurately decode facial expressions, which become distorted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3525 - Mendeleev’s own words:II I saw in a dream a table where all the elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper. Only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3531 - The most impactful is that of neuroscientist Otto Loewi. Loewi dreamed of a clever experiment on two frogs’ hearts that would ultimately reveal how nerve cells communicate with each other using chemicals (neurotransmitters) released across tiny gaps that separate them (synapses), rather than direct electrical signaling that could only happen if they were physically touching each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3543 - Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones has arguably the best sleep-inspired story, which gave rise to the opening riff of their song “Satisfaction.” Richards would routinely keep a guitar and tape recorder at his bedside to record ideas that would come to him in the night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3565 - In chapter 7 I described the phenomenon of sleep inertia—the carryover of the prior sleeping brain state into wakefulness in the minutes after waking up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3585 - Upon awakenings from NREM sleep, participants did not appear to be especially creative, solving few of the anagram puzzles. But it was a different story when I woke them up out of REM sleep, from the dreaming phase. Overall, problem-solving abilities rocketed up, with participants solving 15 to 35 percent more puzzles when emerging from REM sleep compared with awakenings from NREM sleep or during daytime waking performance!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3609 - As we enter REM sleep and dreaming takes hold, an inspired form of memory mixology begins to occur. No longer are we constrained to see the most typical and plainly obvious connections between memory units. On the contrary, the brain becomes actively biased toward seeking out the most distant, nonobvious links between sets of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3619 - First, if we feed a waking brain with the individual ingredients of a problem, novel connections and problem solutions should preferentially—if not exclusively—emerge after time spent in the REM dreaming state, relative to an equivalent amount of deliberative time spent awake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3621 - Second, the content of people’s dreams, above and beyond simply having REM sleep, should determine the success of those hyper-associative problem-solving benefits. As with the effects of REM sleep on our emotional and mental well-being explored in the previous chapter, the latter would prove that REM sleep is necessary but not sufficient. It is both the act of dreaming and the associated content</p>

It is both the act of dreaming and the associated content of those dreams that determine creative success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3641 - Our human memories are, on the other hand, richly interconnected in webs of associations that lead to flexible, predictive powers. We have REM sleep, and the act of dreaming, to thank for much of that inventive hard work.</p>
</li>

<p>loc 4234 - how well we sleep: (1) constant electric light as well as LED light, (2) regularized temperature, (3) caffeine (discussed in chapter 2),</p>

<li>
<p>loc 4309 - First, individuals lost significant amounts of REM sleep following iPad reading. Second, the research subjects felt less rested and sleepier throughout the day following iPad use at night. Third was a lingering aftereffect, with participants suffering a ninety-minute lag in their evening rising melatonin levels for several days after iPad use ceased—almost like a digital hangover effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4346 - Going for such long stretches of time without dream sleep produces a tremendous buildup in, and backlog of, pressure to obtain REM sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4391 - Many people enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, even an aperitif thereafter. But it takes your liver and kidneys many hours to degrade and excrete that alcohol, even if you are an individual with fast-acting enzymes for ethanol decomposition. Nightly alcohol will disrupt your sleep, and the annoying advice of abstinence is the best, and most honest, I can offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4398 - To successfully initiate sleep, as described in chapter 2, your core temperature needs to decrease by 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 1 degree Celsius.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4409 - Most of the thermic work is performed by three parts of your body in particular: your hands, your feet, and your head. All three areas are rich in crisscrossing blood vessels, known as the arteriovenous anastomoses, that lie close to the skin’s surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4416 - You may think the feeling of being facially clean helps you sleep better, but facial cleanliness makes no difference to your slumber. The act itself does have sleep-inviting powers, however, as that water, warm or cold, helps dissipate heat from the surface of the skin as it evaporates, thereby cooling the inner body core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4445 - Scientists have, for example, gently warmed the feet or the body of rats to encourage blood to rise to the surface of the skin and emit heat, thereby decreasing core body temperature. The rats drifted off to sleep far faster than was otherwise normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4457 - Not satisfied with their success, the scientists took on the challenge of improving sleep in two far more problematic groups: older adults who generally have a harder time falling asleep, and patients with clinical insomnia whose sleep was especially stubborn. Just like the young adults, the older adults fell asleep 18 percent faster than normal when receiving the same thermal assistance from the bodysuit. The improvement in the insomniacs was even more impressive—a 25 percent reduction</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4484 - Most of us are unaware of an even greater danger that lurks within the alarm clock: the snooze button. If alarming your heart, quite literally, were not bad enough, using the snooze feature means that you will repeatedly inflict that cardiovascular assault again and again within a short span of time.</p>
