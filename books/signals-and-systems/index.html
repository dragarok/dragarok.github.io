<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 274 - Note that a sequence obtained by uniform sampling of a periodic continuous-time signal may not be periodic (Probs. 1.12 and Probs. 1.13). Note also that the sum of two continuous-time periodic signals may not be periodic but that the sum of two periodic sequences is always periodic (Probs. 1.14 and Probs. 1.15).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 418 - Thus, the sequence is not periodic for any value of Ω0. It is periodic only if Ω0/2π is a rational number. Note that this property is quite different from the property that the continuous-time signal is periodic for any value of ω0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 418 - Thus, the sequence is not periodic for any value of Ω0. It is periodic only if Ω0/2π is a rational number. Note that this property is quite different from the property that the continuous-time signal is periodic for any value of ω0. Thus, if Ω0 satisfies the periodicity condition in Eq. (1.54), Ω0 ≠ 0, and N and m have no factors in common, then the fundamental period of the sequence x[n] in Eq. (1.52) is N0 given by</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 425 - Another very important distinction between the discrete-time and continuous-time complex exponentials is that the signals are all distinct for distinct values of ω0 but that this is not the case for the signals .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 428 - Consider the complex exponential sequence with frequency (Ω0 + 2πk), where k is an integer: since ej2πkn = 1. From Eq. (1.56) we see that the complex exponential sequence at frequency Ω0 is the same as that at frequencies (Ω0 ± 2π), (Ω0 ± 4π), and so on. Therefore, in dealing with discrete-time exponentials, we need only consider an interval of length 2π in which to choose Ω0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 479 - Note that in a continuous-time system the input x(t) and output y(t) are often expressed by a differential equation (see Prob. 1.32) and in a discrete-time system the input x[n] and output y[n] are often expressed by a difference equation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 483 - An example of a memoryless system is a resistor R with the input x(t) taken as the current and the voltage taken as the output y(t). The input-output relationship (Ohm’s law) of a resistor is An example of a system with memory is a capacitor C with the current as the input x(t) and the voltage as the output y(t); then A second example of a system with memory is a discrete-time system whose input and output sequences are related by E.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 490 - A system is called causal if its output at the present time depends on only the present and/or past values of the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 493 - Example of noncausal systems are Note that all memoryless systems are causal, but not vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 512 - A system is called time-invariant if a time shift (delay or advance) in the input signal causes the same time shift in the output signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 520 - If the system is linear and also time-invariant, then it is called a linear time-invariant (LTI) system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 521 - A system is bounded-input/bounded-output (BIBO) stable if for any bounded input x defined by the corresponding output y is also bounded defined by where k1 and k2 are finite real constants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 525 - An unstable system is one in which not all bounded inputs lead to bounded output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 525 - An unstable system is one in which not all bounded inputs lead to bounded output. For example, consider the system where output y[n] is given by y[n] = (n + 1)u[n], and input x[n] = u[n] is the unit step sequence. In this case the input u[n] = 1, but the output y[n] increases without bound as n increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 722 - In other words, the sum of two periodic signals is periodic only if the ratio of their respective periods can be expressed as a rational number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 786 - Using the trigonometric identity sin2 θ = (1 – cos 2θ), we can write where is a dc signal with an arbitrary period and is periodic with T2 = 2π/ω2 = π. Thus, x(t) is periodic with fundamental period T0 =</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1343 - C. Convolution Integral: Equation (2.5) defines the convolution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4393 - Hence, as in the case of periodic signals, the amplitude spectrum |X(ω)| is an even function and the phase spectrum φ(ω) is an odd function of ω.</p>
