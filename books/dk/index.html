<li>
<p>loc 216 - &ldquo;You have to have the imagination to recognize a discovery when you make one.&rdquo; Clyde Tombaugh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 225 - &ldquo;What a wonderful and amazing scheme have we here of the magnificent vastness of the universe.&rdquo; Christiaan Huygens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 235 - in 1979, the first example of a gravitational lens was identified, when the image of a quasar was seen to be double due to the presence of a galaxy along the line of sight, again as relativity had predicted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 247 - Up to the 19th century, astronomers could only chart the positions and movements of heavenly bodies. This led the French philosopher Auguste Comte to state in 1842 that it would never be possible to determine the compositions of planets or stars. Then, some two decades later, new techniques for the spectrum analysis of light began to open up the possibility of investigating the physical nature of stars and planets. A new word was invented to distinguish this new field from traditional astronomy: astrophysics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 259 - &ldquo;If astronomy teaches anything, it teaches that man is but a detail in the evolution of the universe.&rdquo; Percival Lowell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 324 - Aristotle believed that Earth’s atmosphere, too, was stationary. At the top of the atmosphere, friction occurred between the atmospheric gases and the rotating sky above. Episodic emanations of gases from volcanoes rose to the top of the atmosphere. Ignited by friction, these gases produced comets, and, if ignited quickly, they produced shooting stars. His reasoning remained widely accepted until the 16th century.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 347 - Aristarchus persuaded at least one later astronomer—Seleucus of Seleucia, who lived in the second century BCE—of the truth of his heliocentric (sun-centered) view of the universe, but otherwise it seems his ideas did not gain wide acceptance. By the time of Ptolemy, in about 150 CE, the prevailing view was still a geocentric (Earth-centered) one, and this remained the case until the 15th century, when the heliocentric viewpoint was revived by Nicolaus Copernicus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 369 - In about 130 BCE, the Greek astronomer and mathematician Hipparchus of Nicaea noticed that a star named Spica had moved 2º east of a point on the celestial sphere, called the fall equinox point, compared to its position recorded 150 years earlier. Further research showed him that the positions of all stars had shifted. This shift became known as “precession of the equinoxes.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 404 - “the moon and the planets are Yin; they have shape but no light.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 991 - A planet moves most rapidly when it is nearest the sun, at perihelion; a planet’s slowest motion occurs when it is farthest from the sun, at aphelion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1048 - Looking at the full moon with the naked eye, the lunar diameter is resolved into only 30 picture elements, analogous to individual pixels in a digital photograph. Dark lunar seas and lighter lunar highland are discernible, but individual mountains and their shadows are beyond detection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1070 - Put the eye at the back of a telescope with an objective lens of 1, 2, or 4 cm diameter, and the resolution improves to 1⁄120º, 1⁄240º, and 1⁄480º respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1096 - &ldquo;Galileo had the experience of beholding the heavens as they actually are for perhaps the first time.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1151 - The assumption that Earth does not occupy a privileged place in the cosmos is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1151 - The assumption that Earth does not occupy a privileged place in the cosmos is now known as the Copernican principle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1247 - The gravitational constant is measured by studying the behavior of atoms. The latest figure is given as 6.6719 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2. This is about 1 percent less than the value Henry Cavendish calculated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1315 - However, recent analysis of type 1a supernovae has shown that, over the last nine billion years, G has changed by less than one part in 10 billion, if at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1317 - &ldquo;Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night: God said, “Let Newton be!” and all was light.&rdquo; Alexander Pope</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1354 - Astronomical rocky bodies, such as the asteroids between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, are irregular in shape if they have a diameter of less than about 240 miles (380 km) (the Hughes-Cole limit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1355 - Gravitation is also responsible for the size of the deviations from a sphere that can occur on a planet. There are no mountains on Earth higher than the 5.5 miles (8.8 km) of Mount Everest because the gravitational weight of a taller mountain would exceed the strength of the underlying mantle rock, and sink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1357 - On planets with lower mass, the weight of objects is less, and so mountains can be bigger. The highest mountain on Mars, for instance, Olympus Mons, is nearly three times as high as Everest. The mass of Mars is about one-tenth that of Earth, and its diameter is about half Earth’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1450 - Saturn, Halley suspected that the gravitational</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1511 - Nutation is a small wobble in precession with an 18.6-year cycle. Precession and nutation are both caused by gravitational interactions between the moon, Earth, and sun. Bradley made his discovery public in 1748, after 20 years of observations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1640 - Goodricke also discovered that the star Delta Cephei in the constellation Cepheus varies in brightness with a regular period. It is now known that Delta Cephei is one of a class of stars whose apparent brightness varies because the star itself changes. Stars such as this are called Cepheid variables, and they are key to calculating the distance to other galaxies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1749 - The object that causes the glowing trail is called a meteor. If any of it survives to reach the ground, it is termed a meteorite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1751 - Many meteorites contain small particles called chondrules, which are thought to be material from the asteroid belt that never formed into larger bodies. These are some of the oldest materials in the solar system, and can tell scientists much about its early composition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1788 - Orbital resonance occurs when the gravity of orbiting bodies produces a stable and self-correcting system. An example is the orbits of the neighboring giant planets Jupiter and Saturn, whose orbital periods are in a ratio of 5:2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1838 - In 1800, a group of German-based astronomers led by Franz Xaver von Zach, Heinrich Olbers, and Johann Schröter decided to launch a search of the gap. Their plan was to divide up the zodiac—the strip of sky in which all the planets move—and ask Europe’s top 24 astronomers to patrol one zone each, searching for planetlike motion. The team they put together was dubbed the Celestial Police. But in the end it was straightforward luck, not efficiency, that filled the gap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1975 - Parallax is the apparent movement of a nearby object against distant objects due to the changing position of the observer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2007 - he saw that there are long periods in each cycle when the number of sunspots is low. Herschel had not noticed the pattern because he was observing during what is now called the Dalton Minimum, when overall numbers of sunspots were low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2120 - Importantly, in about 1860, Kirchhoff showed that different patterns of dark lines are the spectral fingerprints of different chemical elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2120 - Importantly, in about 1860, Kirchhoff showed that different patterns of dark lines are the spectral fingerprints of different chemical elements. Here was a way to investigate the composition of the sun and stars. It even led to the discovery of the previously unknown element, helium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2129 - This immense task was undertaken at Harvard College Observatory, where the director Edward Pickering employed a large team of women to carry out the exacting work. Here, Annie Jump Cannon devised the stellar classification system still used today, based on a temperature sequence. Cannon personally classified some 500,000 stellar spectra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2152 - In 1814, a German maker of optical instruments named Joseph von Fraunhofer invented the spectroscope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2202 - American Ira Bowen realizes that the two green lines caused by “nebulium” are produced by oxygen atoms that have lost two electrons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2213 - The second type of nebula he observed was entirely different. Its light spectrum was made of single-wavelength emission lines—energy was being emitted as one color; there were no absorption lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2217 - Huggins’ 1864 observations of the Cat’s Eye planetary nebula in the constellation Draco revealed a spectrum with a single absorption line, produced by hot hydrogen gas. However, the nebula also emitted energy in two strong green lines, which did not correspond to any known chemical element. Some astronomers suggested that they were produced by a new element, dubbed nebulium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2253 - In October that year, English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer developed a spectroscope for observing the chromosphere directly. He also detected its curious light and also assumed it was produced by sodium, but after consulting the chemist Edward Frankland, he changed his mind—the light was not from sodium but from a hitherto unknown element, which he named helium, after helios, the Greek word for the sun. For some years, it was thought that helium only existed on the sun, but in 1895, Scottish chemist William Ramsay succeeded in isolating a sample from a radioactive uranium mineral. A total eclipse of the sun reveals the chromosphere.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 2284 - Schiaparelli’s 1888 atlas of Mars shows land, seas, and a network of straight channels. Here, the south pole is shown at the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2420 - Students of astronomy still learn it by remembering the mnemonic, “Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me,” attributed to Henry Norris Russell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2437 - O stars are mainly giants, typically 20 times as massive as the sun and 10 times as wide. Only 0.00003 percent of main sequence stars are this hot. O-type stars burn their fuel very quickly and release huge amounts of energy. As a result, they have a short life expectancy, which is measured in tens of millions of years, compared to billions for cooler stars. Members of this class have weak lines of hydrogen in their spectra, and strong evidence of ionized helium, which is present because of the high temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2443 - B-type stars have non-ionized helium in their spectra and more evidence of hydrogen. Because they live for only a short time, B-type stars are found in molecular clouds or star-forming regions, since they have not had time to move far from the location in which they formed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2452 - As dwarf stars cool, the hydrogen in their spectra becomes less intense. They also exhibit more absorption lines due to metals. (To an astronomer, everything heavier than helium is a metal.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2455 - In hotter stars, the atoms are too ionized to create absorption lines. F-type stars have a surface temperature of between 6,000 and 7,500 K. Called yellow-white dwarfs, they make up 3 percent of the main sequence and are a little larger than the sun.</p>

<p>loc 2455 - In hotter stars, the atoms are too ionized to create absorption lines. F-type stars have a surface temperature of between 6,000 and 7,500 K. Called yellow-white dwarfs, they make up 3 percent of the main sequence and are a little larger than the sun. The spectra of these stars contain medium-intensity hydrogen lines and strengthening lines for iron and calcium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2458 -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2464 - Type-M are red dwarfs. These are by far the most common main sequence stars, making up 76 percent of the total, although no red dwarf is visible to the naked eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2471 - Class W are thought to be dying supergiant stars. Class C, or carbon stars, are declining red giants. Classes L, Y, and T are a diminishing scale of colder objects, from the coolest red dwarfs to the brown dwarfs, which are not quite large or hot enough to be classed as stars.</p>

Classes L, Y, and T are a diminishing scale of colder objects, from the coolest red dwarfs to the brown dwarfs, which are not quite large or hot enough to be classed as stars. Finally, white dwarfs are class D. These are the hot cores of red giant stars that no longer burn with fusion and are gradually cooling.</p>

Finally, white dwarfs are class D. These are the hot cores of red giant stars that no longer burn with fusion and are gradually cooling. Eventually they should fade to black dwarfs, but it is estimated it will take a quadrillion years for that to happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2505 - Hertzsprung figured out that what Maury had identified as “c-type” stars were radically different from other types in the same category. For example, within the M-class category, or red-colored stars, he noticed that the “c-types” were highly luminous, high-mass, comparatively rare stars—today, these are called red giants or red supergiants, depending on their size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2510 - A typical red giant has a diameter about 50 times that of the sun, and 150 times that of a typical red dwarf. However, a red giant has only about 8–10 times the mass of a red dwarf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2524 - US physicist Robert Leighton introduces the field of helioseismology, a study of the motion of the solar surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2530 - Working at Mount Wilson that same year, Hale was able to take clear images of sunspots in a deep red wavelength emitted by hydrogen. The speckled images reminded Hale of the way iron filings mapped the force field around a magnet. This led him to look for signs of the Zeeman effect in light coming from the sunspots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2590 - Cepheid variables are reasonably easy to recognize because they are among the brightest variable stars, and they have a characteristic light curve, showing fairly rapid increases in brightness followed by a slower tailing off. Today, they are known to be giant yellow stars that “pulsate”—varying in diameter as well as brightness over their cycles—and are very rare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2598 - This meant there was a definite relationship between the periods of Cepheid variables and their average intrinsic brightness or their optical luminosity (the rate at which they emit light energy).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2609 - A Cepheid variable belongs to a class of star called a pulsating variable. These stars expand and contract over a regular cycle, at the same time regularly varying in brightness. They are hottest and brightest shortly after reaching their most contracted phase. The graph of the star’s luminosity (light output) against time is called its light curve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2617 - Hertzsprung realized that by measuring the period of any Cepheid variable it should be possible to determine its luminosity and intrinsic brightness. Then by comparing its intrinsic brightness to its apparent magnitude (measured average brightness from Earth), it should be possible to calculate the distance to the Cepheid variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2630 - Hertzsprung therefore set about determining the distances to a handful of Cepheids in the Milky Way galaxy, using an alternative complex method called statistical parallax, which involves calculating the average movement of a set of stars assumed to be at a similar distance from the sun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2648 - In 1923, however, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble, using the latest in telescopic technology, found a Cepheid variable in the Andromeda nebula, allowing its distance to be measured. This led directly to the confirmation that the Andromeda nebula is a separate large galaxy (and is now called the Andromeda galaxy) outside the Milky Way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2654 - The star RS Puppis is one of the brightest Cepheid variables in the Milky Way. It is about 6,500 light-years from Earth and has a cycle of variability lasting 41.4 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2662 - Today, classical Cepheids are used to measure the distance of galaxies out to about 100 million light-years—well beyond the local group of galaxies.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2723 - The Hertzsprung−Russell diagram shows the distribution of stars by absolute magnitude and spectral class. The diagram formed the basis for developing theories about how stars evolve. (In the absolute magnitude scale, the lower the number, the higher the magnitude.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2781 - 40 Eridani B was the first white dwarf star to be discovered. White dwarfs were later shown to be the hot stellar cores left behind when main sequence stars run out of fuel for nuclear fusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2802 - In 1919, the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford was able to transmute atoms of nitrogen into oxygen by firing particles at them from a radioactive element. There was now ample evidence that nuclear processes could produce new elements and release unimaginable quantities of energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2809 - It turned out that 1.46 solar masses would be the upper limit to make a white dwarf, but there was nothing to stop more massive stars from collapsing into a much denser neutron star or a black hole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2820 - &ldquo;We used to think that if we knew one, we knew two, because one and one are two. We are finding that we must learn a great deal more about “and.”&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2880 - As an object’s velocity (v) approaches light speed (c), the object becomes increasingly squashed in the direction of travel when viewed by a stationary observer. This is not merely an illusion. In the observer’s frame of reference,</p>

<li>
<p>loc 2880 - As an object’s velocity (v) approaches light speed (c), the object becomes increasingly squashed in the direction of travel when viewed by a stationary observer. This is not merely an illusion. In the observer’s frame of reference, the object’s shape really does change.</p>
</li>

<p>loc 2896 - For example, the protons accelerated by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle accelerator travel very close to the speed of light—within 99.999 percent. Additional energy does very little to this speed, and instead boosts mass. At full power, the protons in the LHC are nearly 7,500 times more massive than they were when stationary.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 3020 - If the sun became a black hole, its event horizon would be 2 miles (3 km) from the center. A black hole with Earth’s mass would have a 1⁄3-in (9-mm) radius.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3102 - In 1920, partly prompted by Slipher’s findings, a formal debate took place in Washington, D.C., to discuss whether the spiral nebulae were separate galaxies outside the Milky Way. Now referred to as the “Great Debate,” two eminent American astronomers advocated opposing positions—Harlow Shapley that the spiral nebulae were part of the Milky Way; and Heber D. Curtis that they were far beyond it. Neither astronomer changed his position as a result of the debate, but many perceptive figures were concluding by this time that the spirals had to be outside the Milky Way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3119 - By the late 1920s, Hubble had used this result to confirm that the universe is expanding. Thus, Slipher’s work in the years 1912–25 played a crucial role in what today is often considered the greatest astronomical discovery of the 20th century, paving the way for further investigations into the motions of galaxies and cosmological theories based on an expanding universe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3176 - In 1925, Payne’s thesis was sent to the astronomer Henry Russell for review. Russell declared that Payne’s results were “clearly impossible,” and pressured her to include a statement saying that the levels of hydrogen and helium she had found were “almost certainly not real.” Four years later, however, Russell conceded that Payne was right. Payne’s discoveries were revolutionary. First, she established that most stars are chemically similar. Second, she demonstrated how to determine the temperature of any star from its spectrum. Third, she showed that hydrogen and helium are dominant elements in the universe—a key step toward the Big Bang theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3265 - Since all gases obey the same laws, assuming that the sun is not only gaseous at the surface but throughout allows the calculation of the temperature and pressure at the center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3306 - Einstein’s insight led many to revisit the idea that the universe started small, among them the Belgian priest Georges Lemaître, whose 1931 proposal would carry echoes of The Rigveda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3320 - The exact relationship between mass, space, and time was explained in a series of 10 complex equations. These were called Einstein’s field equations. Einstein found an initial solution to his equations that suggested the universe is contracting. Since he could not believe this, he introduced a “fix”—an expansion-inducing factor called the cosmological constant—to balance the inward pull of gravity. This allowed for a static universe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3346 - In 1931, he suggested that the universe was initially a single, extremely dense particle containing all its matter and energy—a “primeval atom” as he called it, about 30 times the size of the sun. This disintegrated in an explosion, giving rise to space and time on “a day without yesterday.” Lemaître described the beginning of the universe as a burst of fireworks, comparing galaxies to the burning embers spreading out from the center of the blast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3364 - Lemaître’s idea about the original size of the universe is now considered incorrect. Today, cosmologists believe it started from an infinitesimally small point of infinite density called a singularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3446 - Hubble’s result provided a simple link between his redshift-measured velocities and distance, and with it, the convincing proof that the scientific community needed. “Hubble’s law,” stating that the redshift of galaxies is proportional to their distance from Earth, was accepted almost unanimously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3464 - Hubble showed how fast spacetime is expanding by plotting a straight-line graph—which he grandly called the “K-factor.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3477 - Calculating the rate of expansion of the cosmos drove the decision to develop the Hubble Space Telescope from its inception in the 1970s to its 1990 launch. NASA made one of the telescope’s “Key Projects” determining the Hubble Constant to within 10 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3504 - Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulates the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. This leads to recognition of the phenomenon of electron degeneracy pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3511 - White dwarfs were prevented from collapsing by a phenomenon known as electron degeneracy pressure. This meant that, when electrons were packed very close together, their movement was limited, creating outward pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3514 - Chandrasekhar figured out that electron degeneracy pressure can prevent a white dwarf from collapsing only up to an upper limit for the white dwarf’s mass, which is about 1.4 times the mass of the sun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3538 - Jansky matched most sources of radio waves to approaching thunderstorms, but there was a persistent hiss that remained unidentified. The intensity of this static rose and fell once a day, and initially Jansky thought he was detecting radio from the sun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3559 - In 185 CE, Chinese astronomers recorded a phenomenon they called a “guest star.” The star had appeared in the direction of Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to Earth, and had shone brightly for eight months before vanishing. This is probably the first recording of a supernova.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3564 - It was not until the 1930s that two astronomers at Caltech in California, Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky, calculated that some novae released much more energy than others. For example, they calculated that S Andromedae, a nova seen in 1885, had released the equivalent of 10 million years of the sun’s output all at once. Baade and Zwicky dubbed these incredibly energetic events “super-novae.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3572 - A neutron star is only about 7 miles (11 km) across, but has huge density and gravitational pull. Neutrons can be packed more closely than atomic nuclei, meaning that a teaspoon of neutron star weighs 10 million tons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3576 - The concept of a neutron star remained purely hypothetical until 1967, when pulsars were discovered. Pulsars were shown to be rapidly spinning neutron stars. In 1979, a powerful burst of gamma rays was detected. This has since been attributed to a “magnetar”—a kind of neutron star with a magnetic field billions of times greater than Earth’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3578 - Many mysteries remain regarding collapsing stars. Only stars above the Chandrasekhar Limit of 1.4 solar masses will become supernovae and form neutron stars. A star above 3 solar masses goes further and becomes a black hole. There may be a halfway stage in which neutron matter degenerates even more into quark particles—the particles from which neutrons and protons are made. Quark stars remain hypothetical, but the search for them is on.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3683 - Seyfert galaxies are just one variety of a class of galaxies called active galaxies. These have central regions, termed active galactic nuclei (AGNs), in which an extraordinary amount of violent activity occurs. Quasars are another type of AGN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3720 - Big Splash In the last decade, computer modeling of possible impacts has suggested an event now dubbed the Big Splash. In this scenario, a Mars-sized planet (named Theia, after the mother of the moon in Greek mythology) hit Earth 4.3 billion years ago—about 200 million years after Earth’s formation. The impact turned both bodies into seething balls of magma. Most of Theia merged with Earth (which explains why the planet has an oversized metallic core) and the “splash” hurled magma into orbit, mostly from the rocky outer region of the planet. This material formed the moon. Although the Big Splash idea is very much a hypothesis at present, it remains the best guess as to the origins of the moon.</p>

<p>loc 3778 - The scientific term for twinkling is scintillation. It is caused when light passes through layer upon layer of turbulent air in the atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3784 - The impact twinkling has on capturing sharp astronomical images is called “seeing.” When the atmosphere is very still and seeing is good, the image of a distant star in a telescope is a small steady disk. When seeing is poor, the image breaks up into a squirming cluster of dots. An image taken over a period of time is smeared out into a larger disk. The effect is similar to the telescope being out of focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3796 - AO systems use minutely adjustable mirrors and other optical devices, but they also rely heavily on computers to filter out the atmospheric “noise” from images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3802 - Adaptive optics requires a clear star as a reference point. As these are hard to find, a sodium laser creates a “star” by lighting up dust in the high atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3825 - Analysis of the images revealed that the mirror was the wrong shape around the edge. The error was tiny—about 2 millionths of a meter—but enough to send the light captured by the outer part of the primary mirror to the wrong area of the secondary mirror, creating serious aberrations in the images. This was a worrying moment for Spitzer and his team, as it seemed as if HST might be about to prove an embarrassing failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3836 - Astronauts serviced HST four more times after 1993 and for the last time in 2009, in one of the final shuttle missions. The shuttles were retired in 2011, after which it would not be possible to service HST again. However, that final service added significant upgrades, which mean that HST may remain in use until 2040.</p>

The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched in 1999, and is tasked with finding black holes, infant solar systems, and supernovae. The final member is the Spitzer Space Telescope, which entered space in 2003. One of its tasks was to peer into nebulae to pick out the hot zones where stars are forming. In 2009, the liquid helium that kept its heat-sensitive detectors cool finally ran out.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3914 - Atomic nuclei formed from protons and neutrons in the first minutes of the universe. Most neutrons ended up in helium-4 nuclei. Small amounts of helium-3 and deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen) and tiny amounts of lithium-7 were also made. Another isotope of hydrogen—tritium—formed, and decayed to helium-3. Energy was released in the form of gamma rays.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3951 - In 1946, Hoyle showed that in the cores of massive stars where the temperature soars to billions of degrees heavier elements could be made in circumstances called nuclear thermal equilibrium. Such a star would eventually explode as a supernova and eject its heavy elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3961 - Further developments There was a flaw in Hoyle’s stellar element-building scheme, however. A key step known as the triple alpha process, in which three helium nuclei fuse to make carbon, appeared to be too slow. Hoyle insisted that there must be a mechanism allowing it to happen at a faster speed and, in 1953, a certain property of carbon was discovered that explained it.</p>

<p>loc 3989 - Bart Bok was an unusual observational astronomer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3992 - US astronomer Edith Reilly, Bok proposed that these bodies were dense clouds of gas and dust that were in the process of collapsing under their own gravity, and that a new star was forming inside. The dust, formed from specks of silica, water ice, and frozen gases, was dense enough to block out the light of surrounding stars. As a result, no light came out of the cloud, and the light from any stars behind the cloud (from Earth’s perspective) could not pass through. Bok and Reilly likened these clouds to a caterpillar’s cocoon, from which a new, brilliant star would one day emerge.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 4009 - Bok globules weigh about 50 times the mass of the sun. They mostly comprise molecular hydrogen (H2), but about 1 percent is dust. The dust comprises particles made of multiple molecules, and is highly concentrated. The obscuring effect of the dust prevents heat from penetrating the globule, and the temperatures inside are among the coldest measured in the universe—about 10 Kelvin. The outward pressure of the cold gas is weaker than the inward pull of gravity, and a shockwave from a nearby supernova can make the cold clouds collapse. They then become denser and denser until a hot stellar core forms.</p>
</li>

<p>loc 4188 - Cocconi and Morrison focused on the “21-cm line,” a radiation emission line (characteristic wavelength) of a hydrogen atom. In the high-frequency radio (microwave) band, this 1420 MHz radiation is emitted when protons and electrons within a hydrogen atom change their energy state. Its discovery, in 1951, allowed the distribution of hydrogen across the galaxy to be mapped using radio waves, which, unlike visible light, are not blocked by dust clouds. Since this line is universal, Cocconi and Morrison argued that it would be known to all intelligent civilizations, and that any search should begin by looking for transmissions around this frequency band.</p>

<p>loc 4226 - So great was the contribution of American geologist Eugene Shoemaker to planetary science that he is the only person whose ashes have been sent to the moon. He was a founding figure of astrogeology, a science that uses the techniques of geology to investigate alien worlds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4233 - Not until 1960 did Shoemaker find the evidence. The crater contains shocked silica only seen previously at nuclear bomb test sites. These minerals cannot have been made naturally by volcanic forces: only the energy of a meteorite traveling at 40,000 mph (60,000 km/h) could have done it. That energy had vaporized the meteorite, which explained why it was missing.</p>

Instead of swooping downward like the curve of the solar system, the speed data of the galactic curve stayed relatively level with distance. This meant that the outer regions of Andromeda were moving at the same speed as the areas nearer to the center. If the galaxy’s mass was limited to what could be observed using telescopes, the outer regions of Andromeda would be moving faster than escape velocity, and they should simply fly off into space.

<p>loc 5442 - One of the problems with the Big Bang theory came from the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), which describes how the forces of the universe (aside from gravity) arose a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. The GUT predicted that high temperatures at this time would create bizarre features, such as so-called magnetic monopoles (particles with only one magnetic pole).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5465 - It is not possible to visualize warped three-dimensional space, but if one dimension were removed, the geometry of space could be shown as curved (where the internal angles of a triangle would add to more than 180°); saddle-shaped (where the angles would be less than 180°); and flat (Euclidean), where a triangle with angles of 180° would be drawn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5508 - The size of the voids puzzled astronomers. They were too large to have been emptied completely by the gravitational collapse of material that formed the stars and galaxies, which meant that they must have been empty since the beginning of the universe. Cosmologists theorize that the large-scale order of superclusters and voids is the legacy of quantum fluctuations during the inflationary epoch of the universe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5542 - Shu’s system is called the “singular isothermal model,” or the “inside-out model.” It is built from the complex mathematics that define the dynamics of gas clouds, taking into account factors such as temperature, density, electrical charge, and magnetism. Shu’s model works by making the process self-similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5548 - GMCs are vast regions of the galaxy filled with hydrogen atoms and molecules mixed with specks of dust and ice. Typically, a GMC contains 100,000 solar masses of material, which is a mixture of primordial gases produced by the Big Bang and the remnants of long-dead stars. GMCs are mostly found in the spiral arms of a galaxy. In the mid-1960s, Shu and the renowned Chinese−American mathematician Chia-Chiao Lin modeled the rotation of a spiral galaxy, and showed that the arms are located at density waves—“traffic jams” of stars. Such density waves sweep up interstellar material into GMCs, and this triggers the formation of stars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5564 - The protostar is also surrounded by a disk of material formed by the system’s rotation, and wave upon wave of material is pulled in from the surrounding envelope of gas. With each wave, the mass of the protostar and its more diffuse disk grows, and its gravity grows with it. The increasing gravity steadily pulls in material from farther away, hence the description of the process as an “inside-out collapse.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5570 - The protostar warms up as it becomes denser, but it is still too small and cold to produce energy by fusing hydrogen in its core. The force of all of the new material landing on its surface also adds to the heat signature given out by the protostar. At this stage, it is giving out only faint infrared and microwave radiation, which makes it hard to see. Eventually, however, the protostar gathers enough mass for fusion to begin, but initially only the deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, begins to burn. Unlike an “adult” star, a protostar releases its heat entirely by a process of convection. Heat from its core rises up to the surface in the same way that hot water in a pan rolls around as it boils. The convection and rotation of the star create a strong magnetic field, which pushes out from each pole, clearing a narrow hole in the envelope of gas and dust. The growing protostar’s heat and a stellar wind of plasma are directed away from the star via these polar jets. These features, explained by Shu’s model, have been confirmed by observations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5581 - A star with the mass of the sun spends about 10 million years as a protostar. As its mass increases, the angle of its polar jets widens, pushing away more of the gas cloud. Eventually, the protostar’s stellar wind blasts out from the entire star’s surface, and it clears its gas cloud away completely. At this point, the young stellar object is revealed for the first time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5592 - The final phase of star formation is a contraction of the fast-spinning PMS star. Red, orange, and yellow dwarfs (M, K, G, and F type stars) form from PMS stars that are less than 2 solar masses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5598 - PMS stars are the earliest stage of star formation that have been seen clearly. Infrared space telescopes such as Spitzer and Hubble have given faint glimpses of protostars but mostly they are too heavily shrouded by the dark dust clouds. NASA’s new infrared James Webb Space Telescope is designed to be sensitive enough to see through that dust, so perhaps soon the moment when a star is born may at last be observed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5630 - The detectors on COBE, designed and run by George Smoot, John Mather, and Mike Hauser, were able to find the oldest structures in the visible universe, described by Smoot as “wrinkles in time.” These wrinkles in otherwise uniform space were once dense regions containing the matter that would form stars and galaxies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5634 - The CMB is a flash of radiation that was released about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, at the time the first atoms formed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5646 - Black bodies do not really exist—they cannot be made and no object observed in the universe functions as black bodies do in theory. However, the CMB is the closest match that has ever been found. A black body absorbs all radiation that hits it. Nothing is reflected. However, the absorbed radiation adds to the thermal energy of the object, and this is released as radiation. In 1900, German Max Planck, the founding figure of quantum physics, showed that the spectrum of radiation released by a black body is entirely dependent on temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5654 - The temperature of the CMB today is a chilly 2.7 K. The thermal spectrum at that temperature contains no visible light, which is why space looks black to human eyes. However, the spectrum has redshifted (stretched) over time as the universe has expanded. Extrapolating back to the moment the CMB was emitted gives an original temperature of about 3,000 K. The color of radiation at this temperature is orange, so the CMB started out as a flash of orange light that shone out from every point in space. Smooth signal The early observations of the CMB suggested that it was isotropic, which means that its spectrum is the same everywhere.</p>

<p>loc 5661 - So the isotropic nature of the CMB suggested that, in those early days, space had a uniform density, or spread of energy. However, this did not tally with the developing theories of the Big Bang, which demanded that matter and energy were not evenly spread through the young universe, but had been concentrated together in places. These denser areas, or anisotropies, were where the stars and galaxies formed.</p>

<p>loc 5690 - By 1992, the COBE team’s analysis had shown what they were looking for. The CMB, and thus the early universe, was not a uniform blob of energy. Instead it was riddled with tiny but significant fluctuations. The differences were minute, with density variations of about 0.001 percent. However, the pattern was enough to explain why the contents of the universe are clustered together, while the rest of space is made from vast empty voids.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5793 - When a large Jupiter-like planet orbits its star, it exerts a gravitational pull on the star. Both star and planet revolve around a common center of gravity. The “wobble” in the star’s orbit allows the planet to be detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5797 - The star’s gravity is far greater than that of the planet, and this is what keeps the planet in orbit. However, the planet’s gravity also has a small effect on the star, making it wobble back and forth as the planet moves around it. The effect is tiny: Jupiter changes the sun’s speed by about 12 miles/s (7.4 km/s) over a period of 11 years, while Earth’s effect is only 0.1 miles/s (0.16 km/s) each year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5811 - The wobble method of detection was very slow, so new techniques of spotting exoplanets were developed. The most successful method was the transit method, which looked for periodic changes in the brightness of a star. These changes were very small and happened when a planet transited the star, passing between the star and the observer, and causing it to dim very slightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5817 - Kepler was placed in a heliocentric orbit, trailing behind Earth as it circled the sun. The craft was designed to keep its aperture firmly fixed on a single patch of space, called the Kepler field. This made up only about 0.25 percent of the whole sky, but the spacecraft could see 150,000 stars in that area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5821 - Kepler could only detect the transits of exoplanets with orbital paths that crossed the spacecraft’s line of sight. Many exoplanets would be orbiting at the wrong angle for that. Those that were correctly oriented would only transit their star once every orbital period (the planet’s year), so Kepler’s method was better at finding planets that orbited close to their star, taking a few years and months (or even weeks and days) to complete each revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5828 - By the start of 2013, Kepler had identified about 4,300 candidate stars that might have extrasolar planetary systems. Unfortunately, the guidance system used to keep Kepler locked on target then failed, bringing its planet hunt to an end about three years sooner than expected. However, the data it had collected was enough to keep researchers busy for years to come. Kepler’s candidate stars could only be confirmed as planetary systems using radial velocity measurements from ground-based observatories, such as HARPS in Chile and the Keck Telescope in Hawaii. (Radial velocity is the velocity of the star in the direction of Earth.) So far, about a tenth of Kepler’s candidate stars have proved to be false positives but, after three years of analysis, the program had identified 1,284 exoplanets, with more than 3,000 stars left to examine. The statistics for the exoplanets in the</p>

<p>loc 5853 - For instance, Corot-3b is a super-Jupiter that is 22 times as heavy as Jupiter but more or less the same size, due to its gravity holding its gaseous contents together. Astronomers have calculated that the density of Corot-3b is greater than that of gold and even osmium, the densest element on Earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5859 - When a super-Jupiter reaches 60 Jupiter masses, it is no longer regarded as a planet, but as a brown dwarf. A brown dwarf is essentially a failed star—a ball of gas that is too small to burn brightly through nuclear fusion. The brown dwarf and its star are seen as a binary star system, not a planetary one.</p>

If and when Earth-like planets are found, astrobiologists will look at the atmospheric chemistry for signs of life, such as the presence of elevated levels of oxygen, produced by photosynthesizing life-forms.

<p>loc 5946 - Ghez’s team found that the stars closest to Sgr A* were orbiting at a quarter of the speed of light.

<p>loc 6035 - The value of Einstein’s cosmological constant is set to match the energy contained in a vacuum—in empty space. This was assumed to be zero. However, according to quantum theory, even a vacuum contains “virtual” particles, which exist for a Planck time (10-43 seconds, the smallest possible amount of time) and then disappear again. Dark energy may match this idea—a form of energy arising from these virtual particles, which creates a negative pressure that pulls space apart, and represents a nonzero value for the cosmological constant.</p>

<p>loc 6558 - It is hoped that the discovery of gravitational waves will provide a new way of observing the universe. Instead of using light or other electromagnetic radiation, astronomers are hoping to map the universe by the gravitational effects of its contents. While radiation is obscured in many ways, including by the opaque plasma of the early universe up to 380,000 years after the Big Bang, gravitational waves pass through everything. This means that gravitational astronomy could see back to the very beginning of time, a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 6573 - All masses are in motion—planets, stars, even galaxies—and as they move, they leave a trail of gravitational disturbances in their wake. Gravity waves propagate in a comparable way to sound waves, by distorting the medium through which they travel. In the case of sound waves, that medium is made of molecules, which are made to oscillate. In the case of gravity, the medium is spacetime, the very fabric of the universe.</p>

<p>loc 6585 - LIGO’s source of waves is a laser, which is a light beam that contains a single color, or wavelength, of light. In addition, the light in a laser beam is coherent, which means that its oscillations are all perfectly in time. Such beams can be made to interfere with one another in very precise ways. The laser beam is split in two and the resulting beams are sent off perpendicular to one another. They both hit a mirror and bounce straight back to the starting point. The distance traveled by each beam is very precisely controlled so that one has to travel exactly half a wavelength farther than the other (a difference of a few hundred billionths of a meter). When the beams meet each other again, they are exactly out of phase as they interfere, and promptly disappear—unless a gravitational wave has passed through space while the beams were traveling. If present, a gravitational wave would stretch one of the laser tracks and compress the other, so the beams would end up traveling slightly altered distances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 6594 - With no gravitational waves, LIGO’s light waves cancel one another out when they are recombined. Gravitational waves stretch one tube while compressing the other, so that the waves are no longer perfectly aligned, and a signal is produced.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 6601 - The difficulty was that such a sensitive detector was prone to distortions from the frequent seismic waves that run through Earth’s surface. To be sure that a laser flicker was not an earth tremor, two identical detectors were built at opposite ends of the United States: one in Louisiana, the other in Washington state. Only signals registering on both detectors were gravitational waves (the signals are in fact 10 milliseconds apart—the time it takes for light, and gravitational waves, to travel from Louisiana to Washington). Ligo operated from 2002–2010 with no success, then started up again in 2015 with enhanced sensitivity.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 6622 - LIGO splits one beam of laser light and sends beams down two tubes at 90° to each other. To prevent unwanted interference, the tubes are vacuums at one trillionth of the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere.
