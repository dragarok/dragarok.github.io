<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 209 - That is one of the tricks of opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often comes disguised in the form of misfortune or temporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so many fail to recognise opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 224 - He had no money to begin with. He had but little education. He had no influence. But he did have initiative, faith and the will to win. With these intangible forces he made himself number one man with the greatest inventor who ever lived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 322 - WHEN RICHES BEGIN TO COME, THEY COME SO QUICKLY, IN SUCH GREAT ABUNDANCE, THAT ONE WONDERS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN HIDING DURING ALL THOSE LEAN YEARS. This is an astounding statement, and all the more so when we take into consideration the popular belief that riches come only to those who work hard and long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 335 - One of the main weaknesses of mankind is the average person’s familiarity with the word ‘impossible’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 335 - One of the main weaknesses of mankind is the average person’s familiarity with the word ‘impossible’. He knows all the rules that will not work. He knows all the things that cannot be done. This book was written for those who seek the rules that have made others successful, and are willing to stake everything on those rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 456 - Barnes succeeded because he chose a definite goal, and placed all his energy, all his willpower and all his effort into achieving that goal. He did not become the partner of Edison the day he arrived. He was content to start in the most menial work, as long as it provided an opportunity to take even one step towards his cherished goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 494 - 1. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. It is not sufficient merely to say, ‘I want plenty of money.’ Be definite as to the amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 496 - 2. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 498 - 3. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 499 - 4. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 500 - 5. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire. Name the time limit for its acquisition. State what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 502 - 6. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after rising in the morning. AS YOU READ, SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 516 - It may be of further help to know that the six steps recommended here were carefully scrutinised by Thomas A. Edison. He placed his stamp of approval upon them as being not only the steps essential for the accumulation of money, but also for the attainment of any definite goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 555 - It may interest you to know that Marconi’s ‘friends’ had him taken into custody, and examined in a psychopathic hospital, when he announced he had discovered a principle through which he could send messages through the air, without the aid of wires or other direct physical means of communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 649 - IMAGINE YOURSELF SUCCESSFUL. Always picture yourself successful.Visualise the person you desire to become. Set aside time each day to be alone and undisturbed. Get comfortable and relax. Close your eyes and concentrate on your desires and goals. See yourself in this new environment, capable and self-confident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 652 - REFLECT ON YOUR PAST SUCCESSES. Every success, be it large or small, is proof that you are capable of achieving more successes. Celebrate each success.You can recall it when you begin to lose faith in yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 655 - SET DEFINITE GOALS. Have a clear direction of where you want to go. Be aware when you begin to deviate from these goals and take immediate corrective action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 656 - RESPOND POSITIVELY TO LIFE. Develop a positive self-image.Your image, your reactions to life and your decisions are completely within your control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 827 - Making repeated affirmations to your subconscious mind is the only known method of developing the emotion of faith voluntarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 832 - any impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is finally accepted and acted upon. The subconscious mind proceeds to translate that impulse into its physical equivalent by the most practical procedure available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 843 - Millions of people believe themselves ‘doomed’ to poverty and failure, because of some strange force over which they believe they have no control. They are the creators of their own ‘misfortunes’ because of this negative belief, which is picked up by the subconscious mind and translated into its physical equivalent.</p>
</li>
