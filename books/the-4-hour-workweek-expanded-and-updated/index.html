<p>loc 413 - These individuals have riches just as we say that we “have a fever,” when really the fever has us. —SENECA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 587 - 1. Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 602 - 2. Interest and Energy Are Cyclical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 613 - 3. Less Is Not Laziness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 623 - 4. The Timing Is Never Right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 628 - “Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and correct course along the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 631 - 5. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 636 - 6. Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 643 - 7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 651 - Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time, which is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 652 - 8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 662 - 9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 679 - 10. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 690 - Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 819 - Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 821 - I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 839 - What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 889 - incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for “realistic” goals,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 889 - The level of competition is thus fiercest for “realistic” goals, paradoxically making them the most time- and energy-consuming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 891 - If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 917 - “What would excite me?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 942 - Remember—boredom is the enemy, not some abstract “failure.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 989 - ‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ You won’t believe what you can accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 997 - Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1080 - COMFORT CHALLENGE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1089 - Learn to Eye Gaze (2 days)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1105 - Perfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away. —ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPÉRY,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1113 - Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1148 - 1. Doing something unimportant well does not make it important. 2. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1150 - What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1164 - Pareto’s Law can be summarized as follows: 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1228 - Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being selective—doing less—is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1233 - lack of time is actually lack of priorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1263 - Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1303 - Am I inventing things to do to avoid the important?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1305 - Dedication is often just meaningless work in disguise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1426 - Problems, as a rule, solve themselves or disappear if you remove yourself as an information bottleneck and empower others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1459 - Rediscover the power of the forgotten skill called “talking.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1560 - Learn to be difficult when it counts. In school as in life, having a reputation for being assertive will help you receive preferential treatment without having to beg or fight for it every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2097 - Eliminate before you delegate. Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2115 - Golden Rule #1: Each delegated task must be both time-consuming and well-defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2117 - Golden Rule #2: On a lighter note, have some fun with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2279 - Never use debit cards for online transactions or with remote assistants. Reversing unauthorized credit card charges, particularly with American Express, is painless and near instantaneous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2282 - If your VA will be accessing websites on your behalf, create a new unique login and password to be used on those sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2351 - Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2779 - Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3909 - Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4103 - Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4217 - If you are accustomed to working 50 weeks per year, the tendency, even after creating the mobility to take extended trips, will be to go nuts and see 10 countries in 14 days and end up a wreck. It’s like taking a starving dog to an all-you-can-eat buffet. It will eat itself to death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4235 - True freedom is much more than having enough income and time to do what you want. It is quite possible—actually the rule rather than the exception—to have financial and time freedom but still be caught in the throes of the rat race.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4433 - Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4820 - Subtracting the bad does not create the good. It leaves a vacuum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4881 - and should thus be ignored. These are not worthwhile questions. If you can’t define it or act upon it, forget it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4946 - Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS</p>
</li>
