<li>
<p>loc 2 - Any operation that can be decomposed into a sequence of suboperations of about the same complexity can be implemented by a pipeline processor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2 - The behavior of a pipeline can be illustrated with a space-time diagram. o It shows the segment utilization as a function of time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3 - If we assume that the time it takes to process a task is the same in the pipeline and non-pipeline circuits, i.e. , tn = ktp, the speedup reduces to S=ktp/tp=k.  This shows that the theoretical maximum speed up that a pipeline can provide is k, where k is the number of segments in the pipeline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4 - The purpose of parallel processing is to speed up the computer processing capability and increase its throughput</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 11 - To implement an instruction pipeline using a small number of suboperations, with each being executed in one clock cycle. o Because of the fixed-length instruction format, the decoding of the operation can occur at the same time as the register selection. o Therefore, the instruction pipeline can be implemented with two or three segments.  One segment fetches the instruction from program memory  The other segment executes the instruction in the ALU  Third segment may be used to store the result of the ALU operation in a destination register  The data transfer instructions in RISC are limited to load and store instructions. o These instructions use register indirect addressing. They usually need three or four stages in the pipeline. o To prevent conflicts between a memory access to fetch an instruction and to load or store an operand, most RISC machines use two separate buses with two memories. o Cache memory: operate at the same speed as the CPU clock  One of the major advantages of RISC is its ability to execute instructions at the rate of one per clock cycle. o In effect, it is to start each instruction with each clock cycle and to pipeline the processor to achieve the goal of single-cycle instruction execution. o RISC can achieve pipeline segments, requiring just one clock cycle.  Compiler supported that translates the high-level language program into machine language program. o Instead of designing hardware to handle the difficulties associated with data conflicts and branch penalties. o RISC processors rely on the efficiency of the compiler to detect and minimize the delays encountered with these problems.Example: Three-Segment Instruction Pipeline  Thee are three types of instructions: o The data manipulation instructions: operate on data in processor registersCompiled By: Er.

<p>loc 11 - RISC processors rely on the efficiency of the compiler to detect and minimize the delays encountered with these problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 13 - The method used in most RISC processors is to rely on the compiler to redefine the branches so that they take effect at the proper time in the pipeline. This method is referred to as delayed branch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 15 - vector is an ordered set of a one-dimensional array of data items</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 16 - Pipeline for calculating an inner product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 16 - Pipeline and vector processors often require simultaneous access to memory from two or more sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 17 - o Attached array processor:  Is an auxiliary processor.  It is intended to improve the performance of the host computer in specific numerical computation tasks. o SIMD array processor:  Has a single-instruction multiple-data organization.  It manipulates vector instructions by means of multiple functional units responding to a common instruction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 17 - A commercial computer with vector instructions and pipelined floating-point arithmetic operations is referred to as a supercomputer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 17 - components are packed tightly together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 17 - measure used to evaluate computers in their ability to perform a given number of floating-point operations per second is referred to as flops.  A typical supercomputer has a basic cycle time of 4 to 20 ns.  The examples of supercomputer:  Cray-1: it uses vector processing with 12 distinct functional units in parallel; a large number of registers (over 150); multiprocessor configuration (Cray X-MP and Cray Y-MP) o Fujitsu VP-200: 83 vector instructions and 195 scalar instructions; 300 megaflops 4.7 Array Processing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 17 - The advantage of a modular memory is that it allows the use of a technique called interleaving.  In an interleaved memory, different sets of addresses are assigned to different memory modules.  By staggering the memory access, the effective memory cycle time can be reduced by a factor close to the number of modules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 18 - The objective of the attached array processor is to provide vector manipulation capabilities to a conventional computer at a fraction of the cost of supercomputer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 18 - A general block diagram of an array processor is shown in Fig.9-15. o It contains a set of identical processing elements (PEs), each having a local memory M. o Each PE includes an ALU, a floating-point arithmetic unit, and working registers. o Vector instructions are broadcast to all PEs simultaneously</p>
