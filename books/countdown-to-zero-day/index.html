<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 139 - Rootkits come in several varieties, but the most difficult to detect are kernel-level rootkits, which burrow deep into the core of a machine to set up shop at the same privileged level where antivirus scanners work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 612 - Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a nonprofit nuclear nonproliferation group that tracked nuclear activities in Iran and elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2619 - In 2012, a researcher in the UK found more than 10,000 control systems that were connected to the internet—including ones belonging to water-treatment and power plants, dams, bridges, and train stations—using a specialized search engine called Shodan that can locate devices like VoIP phones, SmartTVs, and control systems that are connected to the internet.35</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3818 - The exercise, dubbed “Eligible Receiver,” pitted a red team of NSA hackers against the networks of the US Pacific Command in Hawaii. The team was prohibited from using inside knowledge to conduct the attack or anything but off-the-shelf tools that were available to ordinary hackers. When the attack began, they launched their offensive through a commercial dial-up internet account and barreled straight into the military’s networks with little resistance. The system administrators in Hawaii, who had no advance knowledge of the exercise, spotted only two of the multiple intrusions the attackers made over the course of ninety days, but even then they thought nothing of the breaches because they resembled the kind of ordinary traffic that administrators expected to see on the network. It wasn’t unlike the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, when an alert operator at the Opana Radar Site on the island of Oahu spotted inbound aircraft heading toward the island but didn’t raise an alarm because his superiors believed they were friendlies. The red-team hackers dropped marker files onto the systems to plant a virtual flag, proving they were there, and also created a number of simulated attacks showing how they could have seized control of power and communications networks in Oahu, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Had they wanted to, they could have seized control of a system used to command hundreds of thousands of troops or set up “rolling blackouts and other activities that would cause social unrest,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3831 - Afterward, when military leaders were briefed about the exercise, they assumed the red team had used classified tools and techniques for the attack and were surprised to learn that the NSA had used the same techniques any teenage hacker would use. The next year, in fact, a group of teenagers broke into military networks using the same kinds of low-level techniques, in a case dubbed Operation Solar Sunrise. The intruders, who pilfered sensitive data across five hundred systems, turned out to be two California teens on a digital joyride,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3971 - In 2008, the NSA had 22,252 implants installed on systems around the world. By 2011, the number had ballooned to 68,975, and in 2013, the agency expected to have 85,000 implants installed, with plans to expand this to millions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4011 - His group, he said, had a huge repository of zero-day vulnerabilities at their disposal—“tens of thousands of ready-to-use bugs” in software applications and operating systems for any given attack. “Literally, if you can name the software or the controller, we have ways to exploit it,” he said. Patched holes didn’t worry them, because for every vulnerability a vendor fixed, they had others to replace it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 6297 - The IR-1s were already fragile by design, and the slightest imperfection could set them off—dust in the chamber, for example, could cause them to self-destruct. The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, revealed during an interview in 2006 that in the early days of the enrichment program, the IR-1s had disintegrated frequently due to germs on the machine.</p>
