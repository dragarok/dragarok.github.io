Short sleeping increases the likelihood of your coronary arteries becoming blocked and brittle, setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 72 - It is disquieting to learn that vehicular accidents caused by drowsy driving exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs combined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 93 - Yet sleep has persisted. Heroically so. Indeed, every</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 94 - every species studied to date sleeps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 111 - Dreaming provides a unique suite of benefits to all species fortunate enough to experience it, humans included. Among these gifts are a consoling neurochemical bath that mollifies painful memories and a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge, inspiring creativity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 118 - A balanced diet and exercise are of vital importance, yes. But we now see sleep as the preeminent force in this health trinity. The physical and mental impairments caused by one night of bad sleep dwarf those caused by an equivalent absence of food or exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 123 - sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 245 - The first was that humans, like de Mairan’s heliotrope plants, generated their own endogenous circadian rhythm in the absence of external light from the sun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 248 - The second unexpected—and more profound—result was that their reliably repeating cycles of wake and sleep were not precisely twenty-four hours in length, but consistently and undeniably longer than twenty-four hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 257 - we have now determined that the average duration of a human adult’s endogenous circadian clock runs around twenty-four hours and fifteen minutes in length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 261 - The light of the sun methodically resets our inaccurate internal timepiece each and every day, “winding” us back to precisely, not approximately, twenty-four hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 295 - Although the temperature drop helps to initiate sleep, the temperature change itself will rise and fall across the twenty-four-hour period regardless of whether you are awake or asleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 314 - An adult’s owlness or larkness, also known as their chronotype, is strongly determined by genetics. If you are a night owl, it’s likely that one (or both) of your parents is a night owl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 349 - Melatonin simply provides the official instruction to commence the event of sleep, but does not participate in the sleep race itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 382 - For every day you are in a different time zone, your suprachiasmatic nucleus can only readjust by about one hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 386 - You may have noticed that it feels harder to acclimate to a new time zone when traveling eastward than when flying westward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 412 - The longer you are awake, the more adenosine will accumulate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 413 - One consequence of increasing adenosine in the brain is an increasing desire to sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 425 - By hijacking and occupying these receptors, caffeine blocks the sleepiness signal normally communicated to the brain by adenosine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 429 - Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 497 - Across the night, sleep lifts the heavy weight of sleep pressure, lightening the adenosine load. After approximately eight hours of healthy sleep in an adult, the adenosine purge is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 534 - First, after waking up in the morning, could you fall back asleep at ten or eleven a.m.? If the answer is “yes,” you are likely not getting sufficient sleep quantity and/or quality. Second, can you function optimally without caffeine before noon? If the answer is “no,” then you are most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 566 - Even sunlight coming through thick cloud on a rainy day is powerful enough to help reset our biological clocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 660 - Kleitman and Aserinsky further demonstrated that REM sleep, in which brain activity was almost identical to that when we are awake, was intimately connected to the experience we call dreaming, and is often described as dream sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 662 - NREM sleep received further dissection in the years thereafter, being subdivided into four separate stages, unimaginatively named NREM stages 1 to 4 (we sleep researchers are a creative bunch), increasing in their depth. Stages 3 and 4 are therefore the deepest stages of NREM sleep you experience, with “depth” being defined as the increasing difficulty required to wake an individual out of NREM stages 3 and 4, compared with NREM stages 1 or 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 678 - In the first half of the night, the vast majority of our ninety-minute cycles are consumed by deep NREM sleep, and very little REM sleep, as can be seen in cycle 1 of the figure above. But as we transition through into the second half of the night, this seesaw balance shifts, with most of the time dominated by REM sleep, with little, if any, deep NREM sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 686 - We have no scientific consensus as to why our sleep (and that of all other mammals and birds) cycles in this repeatable but dramatically asymmetric pattern, though a number of theories exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 692 - As we will discover in chapter 6, a key function of deep NREM sleep, which predominates early in the night, is to do the work of weeding out and removing unnecessary neural connections. In contrast, the dreaming stage of REM sleep, which prevails later in the night, plays a role in strengthening those connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 774 - What you are actually experiencing during deep NREM sleep is one of the most epic displays of neural collaboration that we know of. Through an astonishing act of self-organization, many thousands of brain cells have all decided to unite and “sing,” or fire, in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 816 - For these reasons, REM sleep has also been called paradoxical sleep: a brain that appears awake, yet a body that is clearly asleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 825 - When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 825 - When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as reception (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as reflection (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as integration (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities). Since the electrical brainwaves</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 849 - The brain paralyzes the body so the mind can dream safely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 881 - Without exception, every animal species studied to date sleeps, or engages in something remarkably like it. This includes insects, such as flies, bees, cockroaches, and scorpions;I fish, from small perch to the largest sharks;II amphibians, such as frogs; and reptiles, such as turtles, Komodo dragons, and chameleons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 889 - How “old” does this make sleep? Worms emerged during the Cambrian explosion: at least 500 million years ago. That is, worms (and sleep by association) predate all vertebrate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 889 - How “old” does this make sleep? Worms emerged during the Cambrian explosion: at least 500 million years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 892 - we have discovered that the very simplest forms of unicellular organisms that survive for periods exceeding twenty-four hours, such as bacteria, have active and passive phases that correspond to the light-dark cycle of our planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 900 - sleep is of ancient origin. It appeared with the very earliest forms of planetary life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 906 - Total amount of time is one of the most conspicuous differences in how organisms sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 917 - one evolutionary function that demands more sleep is the need to service an increasingly complex nervous system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 930 - For now, our most accurate estimate of why different species need different sleep amounts involves a complex hybrid of factors, such as dietary type (omnivore, herbivore, carnivore), predator/prey balance within a habitat, the presence and nature of a social network, metabolic rate, and nervous system complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 943 - Only birds and mammals, which appeared later in the evolutionary timeline of the animal kingdom, have full-blown REM sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 948 - most of our assessments to date have not discovered REM sleep—or at least what many sleep scientists would believe to be true REM sleep—in aquatic mammals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 976 - When a theme repeats in evolution, and independently across unrelated lineages, it often signals a fundamental need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1002 - That humans (and all other species) can never “sleep back” that which we have previously lost is one of the most important take-homes of this book,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1006 - Take cetaceans, such as dolphins and whales, for example. Their sleep, of which there is only NREM, can be unihemispheric, meaning they will sleep with half a brain at a time! One half of the brain must always stay awake to maintain life-necessary movement in the aquatic environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1020 - Sleep with both sides of the brain, or sleep with just one side and then switch. Both are possible, but sleep you must. Sleep is non-negotiable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1098 - What becomes clearly apparent when you step back from these details is that modern society has divorced us from what should be a preordained arrangement of biphasic sleep—one that our genetic code nevertheless tries to rekindle every afternoon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1127 - From a prescription written long ago in our ancestral genetic code, the practice of natural biphasic sleep, and a healthy diet, appear to be the keys to a long-sustained life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1171 - From these clues, I offer a theorem: the tree-to-ground reengineering of sleep was a key trigger that rocketed Homo sapiens to the top of evolution’s lofty pyramid. At least two features define human beings relative to other primates. I posit that both have been beneficially and causally shaped by the hand of sleep, and specifically our intense degree of REM sleep relative to all other mammals: (1) our degree of sociocultural complexity, and (2) our cognitive intelligence. REM sleep, and the act of dreaming itself, lubricates both of these human traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1293 - Autistic individuals show a 30 to 50 percent deficit in the amount of REM sleep they obtain, relative to children without autism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1377 - to birth, and soon after, the challenge for development was to build and add vast numbers of neural highways and interconnections that become a fledgling brain. As we have discussed, REM sleep plays an essential role in this proliferation process,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1377 - Prior to birth, and soon after, the challenge for development was to build and add vast numbers of neural highways and interconnections that become a fledgling brain. As we have discussed, REM sleep plays an essential role in this proliferation process,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1381 - a second round of remodeling must take place. It does so during late childhood and adolescence. Here, the architectural goal is not to scale up, but to scale back for the goal of efficiency and effectiveness. The time of adding brain connections with the help of REM sleep is over. Instead, pruning of connections becomes the order of the day or, should I say, night. Enter the sculpting hand of deep NREM sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1421 - deep sleep may be a driving force of brain maturation, not the other way around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1454 - Adolescents face two other harmful challenges in their struggle to obtain sufficient sleep as their brains continue to develop. The first is a change in their circadian rhythm. The second is early school start times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1475 - asking your teenage son or daughter to go to bed and fall asleep at ten p.m. is the circadian equivalent of asking you, their parent, to go to sleep at seven or eight p.m.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1478 - Furthermore, asking that same teenager to wake up at seven the next morning and function with intellect, grace, and good mood is the equivalent of asking you, their parent, to do the same at four or five a.m.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1494 - This ingenious biological solution selectively shifts teenagers to a later phase when they can, for several hours, operate independently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1505 - That older adults simply need less sleep is a myth. Older adults appear to need just as much sleep as they do in midlife, but are simply less able to generate that (still necessary) sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1520 - it means that elderly individuals fail to connect their deterioration in health with their deterioration in sleep,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1520 - it means that elderly individuals fail to connect their deterioration in health with their deterioration in sleep, despite causal links between the two having been known to scientists for many decades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1520 - elderly individuals fail to connect their deterioration in health with their deterioration in sleep, despite causal links between the two having been known to scientists for many decades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1537 - Even when controlling for factors such as body mass index, gender, race, history of smoking, frequency of exercise, and medications, the lower an older individual’s sleep efficiency score, the higher their mortality risk, the worse their physical health, the more likely they are to suffer from depression, the less energy they report, and the lower their cognitive function, typified by forgetfulness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1568 - Add these things up, and a self-perpetuating cycle ensues wherein many seniors are battling a sleep debt, trying to stay awake later in the evening, inadvertently dozing off earlier, finding it hard to fall or stay asleep at night, only to be woken up earlier than they wish because of a regressed circadian rhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1697 - Those who were awake throughout the day became progressively worse at learning, even though their ability to concentrate remained stable (determined by separate attention and response time tests). In contrast, those who napped did markedly better, and actually improved in their capacity to memorize facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1725 - Sleep six hours or less and you are shortchanging the brain of a learning restoration benefit that is normally performed by sleep spindles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1730 - That sleep sets in motion the process of memory consolidation was recognized long ago, and may be one of the oldest proposed functions of sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1759 - if you were a participant in such a study, and the only information I had was the amount of deep NREM sleep you had obtained that night, I could predict with high accuracy how much you would remember in the upcoming memory test upon awakening, even before you took it. That’s how deterministic the link between sleep and memory consolidation can be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1776 - Even daytime naps as short as twenty minutes can offer a memory consolidation advantage, so long as they contain enough NREM sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1883 - sleep was far more intelligent than we had once imagined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1885 - sleep is able to offer a far more discerning hand in memory improvement: one that preferentially picks and chooses what information is, and is not, ultimately strengthened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1902 - my real-world hope is to develop accurate methods for selectively weakening or erasing certain memories from an individual’s memory library when there is a confirmed clinical need, such as in trauma, drug addiction, or substance abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1955 - Practice does not make perfect. It is practice, followed by a night of sleep, that leads to perfection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2043 - final benefit of sleep for memory is arguably the most remarkable of all: creativity. Sleep provides a nighttime theater in which your brain tests out and builds connections between vast stores of information.</p>

<p>loc 2043 - A final benefit of sleep for memory is arguably the most remarkable of all: creativity. Sleep provides a nighttime theater in which your brain tests out and builds connections between vast stores of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2061 - No facet of the human body is spared the crippling, noxious harm of sleep loss. We are, as you will see, socially, organizationally, economically, physically, behaviorally, nutritionally, linguistically, cognitively, and emotionally dependent upon sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2111 - Ten days of six hours of sleep a night was all it took to become as impaired in performance as going without sleep for twenty-four hours straight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2118 - When participants were asked about their subjective sense of how impaired they were, they consistently underestimated their degree of performance disability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2135 - After being awake for nineteen hours, people who were sleep-deprived were as cognitively impaired as those who were legally drunk. Said another way, if you wake up at seven a.m. and remain awake</p>

<li>
<p>loc 2161 - The recycle rate of a human being is around sixteen hours. After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail. Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance. After ten days of just seven hours of sleep, the brain is as dysfunctional as it would be after going without sleep for twenty-four hours. Three full nights of recovery sleep (i.e., more nights than a weekend) are insufficient to restore performance back to normal levels after a week of short sleeping. Finally, the human mind cannot accurately sense how sleep-deprived it is when sleep-deprived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2172 - Drowsy driving alone is worse than driving drunk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2200 - if you are drowsy while driving, please, please stop. It is lethal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2238 - No matter what you may have heard or read in the popular media, there is no scientific evidence we have suggesting that a drug, a device, or any amount of psychological willpower can replace sleep. Power naps may momentarily increase basic concentration under conditions of sleep deprivation, as can caffeine up to a certain dose. But in the subsequent studies that Dinges and many other researchers (myself included) have performed, neither naps nor caffeine can salvage more complex functions of the brain, including learning, memory, emotional stability, complex reasoning, or decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2253 - “The number of people who can survive on five hours of sleep or less without any impairment, expressed as a percent of the population, and rounded to a whole number, is zero.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2270 - A structure located in the left and right sides of the brain, called the amygdala—a key hot spot for triggering strong emotions such as anger and rage, and linked to the fight-or-flight response—showed well over a 60 percent amplification in emotional reactivity in the participants who were sleep-deprived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2294 - Rather, the under-slept brain swings excessively to both extremes of emotional valence, positive and negative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2324 - I am suggesting that sleep disruption remains a neglected factor contributing to the instigation and/or maintenance of numerous psychiatric illnesses,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2401 - Those few memories you are able to learn while sleep-deprived are forgotten far more quickly in the hours and days thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2440 - The two most feared diseases throughout developed nations are dementia and cancer. Both are related to inadequate sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2442 - a lack of sleep is fast becoming recognized as a key lifestyle factor determining whether or not you will develop Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2513 - Without sufficient sleep, amyloid plaques build up in the brain, especially in deep-sleep-generating regions, attacking and degrading them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2568 - Take away the bedrock of sleep, or weaken it just a little, and careful eating or physical exercise become less than effective, as we shall see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2573 - the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2585 - Adults forty-five years or older who sleep fewer than six hours a night are 200 percent more likely to have a heart attack or stroke during their lifetime, as compared with those sleeping seven to eight hours a night.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 2752 - Inadequate sleep is the perfect recipe for obesity: greater calorie intake, lower calorie expenditure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2754 - Van Cauter noticed that cravings for sweets (e.g., cookies, chocolate, and ice cream), heavy-hitting carbohydrate-rich foods (e.g., bread and pasta), and salty snacks (e.g., potato chips and pretzels) all increased by 30 to 40 percent when sleep was reduced by several hours each night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2800 - short sleep (of the type that many adults in first-world countries commonly and routinely report) will increase hunger and appetite, compromise impulse control within the brain, increase food consumption (especially of high-calorie foods), decrease feelings of food satisfaction after eating, and prevent effective weight loss when dieting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2853 - Sleep fights against infection and sickness by deploying all manner of weaponry within your immune arsenal, cladding you with protection. When you do fall ill, the immune system actively stimulates the sleep system, demanding more bed rest to help reinforce the war effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2907 - A large European study of almost 25,000 individuals demonstrated that sleeping six hours or less was associated with a 40 percent increased risk of developing cancer, relative to those sleeping seven hours a night or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2941 - If increasing your risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, depression, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease weren’t sufficiently disquieting, chronic sleep loss will erode the very essence of biological life itself: your genetic code and the structures that encapsulate it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>loc 3084 - The scientists were able to predict with significant accuracy the content of participants’ dreams at any one moment in time using just the MRI scans, operating completely blind to the dream reports of the participants. Using the template data from the MRI images, they could tell if you were dreaming of a man or a woman, a dog or a bed, flowers or a knife. They were, in effect, mind reading, or should I say, dream reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3237 - This was the theory of overnight therapy. It postulated that the process of REM-sleep dreaming accomplishes two critical goals: (1) sleeping to remember the details of those valuable, salient experiences, integrating them with existing knowledge and putting them into autobiographical perspective, yet (2) sleeping to forget, or dissolve, the visceral, painful emotional charge that had previously been wrapped around those memories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3285 - Cartwright had shown that it was not enough to have REM sleep, or even generic dreaming, when it comes to resolving our emotional past. Her patients required REM sleep with dreaming, but dreaming of a very specific kind: that which expressly involved dreaming about the emotional themes and sentiments of the waking trauma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3321 - It turns out that the drug prazosin, which Raskind was prescribing simply to lower blood pressure, also has the fortuitous side effect of suppressing noradrenaline in the brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3477 - Upon awakenings from NREM sleep, participants did not appear to be especially creative, solving few of the anagram puzzles. But it was a different story when I woke them up out of REM sleep, from the dreaming phase. Overall, problem-solving abilities rocketed up, with participants solving 15 to 35 percent more puzzles when emerging from REM sleep compared with awakenings from NREM sleep or during daytime waking performance!</p>

<li>
<p>loc 3482 - Solutions seemed more effortless when the brain was being bathed by the afterglow of dream sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3505 - When awake, we see only a narrow set of all possible memory interrelationships. The opposite is true, however, when we enter the dream state and start looking through the other (correct) end of the memory-surveying telescope. Using that wide-angle dream lens, we can apprehend the full constellation of stored information and their diverse combinatorial possibilities, all in creative servitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3534 - REM sleep is capable of creating abstract overarching knowledge and super-ordinate concepts out of sets of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3540 - REM sleep is especially dominant during this early-life window, and it is that REM sleep that plays a critical role in the development of language, we believe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3622 - Scientists had gained objective, brain-based proof that lucid dreamers can control when and what they dream while they are dreaming.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 3669 - there is nothing pathological about sleepwalking or sleep talking. They are common in the adult population, and even more common in children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3701 - Insomnia is the opposite: (i) suffering from an inadequate ability to generate sleep, despite (ii) allowing oneself the adequate opportunity to get sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3727 - All of us will experience difficulty sleeping every now and then, which may last just one night or several. That is normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3834 - It is this set of features of sleep paralysis that we now believe explains a large majority of alien abduction claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 3940 - Soon after turning forty-two years old, Michael Corke died of a rare, genetically inherited disorder called fatal familial insomnia (FFI). There are no treatments for this disorder, and there are no cures. Every patient diagnosed with the disorder has died within ten months, some sooner. It is one of the most mysterious conditions in the annals of medicine, and it has taught us a shocking lesson: a lack of sleep will kill a human being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4062 - Concluding that humans, modern-living or pre-industrial, need less than seven hours of sleep therefore appears to be a wishful conceit, and a tabloid myth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4081 - There is an adaptive balance to be struck between wakefulness and sleep. In humans, that appears to be around sixteen hours of total wakefulness, and around eight hours of total sleep, for an average adult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4145 - By delaying the release of melatonin, artificial evening light makes it considerably less likely that you’ll be able to fall asleep at a reasonable time.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4190 - Saying that alcohol is a sedative often confuses people, as alcohol in moderate doses helps individuals liven up and become more social. How can a sedative enliven you? The answer comes down to the fact that your increased sociability is caused by sedation of one part of your brain, the prefrontal cortex, early in the timeline of alcohol’s creeping effects.</p>

<p>loc 4196 - is your brain slipping into sedation. Your desire and ability to remain conscious are decreasing, and you can let go of consciousness more easily. I am very deliberately avoiding the term “sleep,” however, because sedation is not sleep. Alcohol sedates you out of wakefulness, but it does not induce natural sleep.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 4201 - First, alcohol fragments sleep, littering the night with brief awakenings. Alcohol-infused sleep is therefore not continuous and, as a result, not restorative.</p>

<p>loc 4266 - Your nocturnal melatonin levels are therefore controlled not only by the loss of daylight at dusk, but also the drop in temperature that coincides with the setting sun.

<p>loc 4326 - You do not fall asleep faster because you are toasty and warm to the core. Instead, the hot bath invites blood to the surface of your skin, giving you that flushed appearance. When you get out of the bath, those dilated blood vessels on the surface quickly help radiate out inner heat, and your core body temperature plummets. Consequently, you fall asleep more quickly because your core is colder. Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4395 - Sleeping pills, old and new, target the same system in the brain that alcohol does—the receptors that stop your brain cells from firing—and are thus part of the same general class of drugs: sedatives. Sleeping pills effectively knock out the higher regions of your brain’s cortex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4426 - Future versions of such drugs may offer meaningful sleep improvements, but for now the scientific data on prescription sleeping pills suggests that they may not be the answer to returning sound sleep to those struggling to generate it on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4437 - Should similar findings continue to emerge, including in humans, pharmaceutical companies may have to acknowledge that, although users of sleeping pills may fall asleep nominally faster at night, they should expect to wake up with few(er) memories of yesterday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4445 - Kripke discovered that individuals using prescription sleep medications are significantly more likely to die and to develop cancer than those who do not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4462 - Those individuals classified as heavy users, defined as taking more than 132 pills per year, were 5.3 times more likely to die over the study period than matched control participants who were not using sleeping pills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 4520 - The obvious methods involve reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, removing screen technology from the bedroom, and having a cool bedroom. In addition, patients must (1) establish a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends, (2) go to bed only when sleepy and avoid sleeping on the couch early/mid-evenings, (3) never lie awake in bed for a significant time period; rather, get out of bed and do something quiet and relaxing until the urge to sleep returns, (4) avoid daytime napping if you are having difficulty sleeping at night, (5) reduce anxiety-provoking thoughts and worries by learning to mentally decelerate before bed, and (6) remove visible clockfaces from view in the bedroom, preventing clock-watching anxiety at night.</p>

<p>loc 5098 - regular, plentiful sleep, as we once knew a century ago. But to battle against rather than unite with technology is the wrong approach in my mind. For one thing, it’s a losing battle: we will never put that technological genie back into its bottle, nor do we need to. Instead, we can use this powerful tool to our advantage. Within three to five years, I am quite certain there will be commercially available, affordable devices that track an individual’s sleep and circadian rhythm with high accuracy. When that happens, we can marry these individual sleep trackers with the revolution of in-home networked devices like thermostats and lighting. Some are already trying to do this as I write. Two exciting possibilities unfold. First, such devices could compare the sleep of each family member in each separate bedroom with the temperature sensed in each room by the thermostat. Using common machine-learning algorithms applied over time, we should be able to intelligently teach the home thermostat what the thermal sweet spot is for each occupant in each bedroom, based on the biophysiology calculated by their sleep-tracking device (perhaps splitting the difference when there are two or more individuals per room). Granted there are many different factors that make for a good or bad night of sleep, but temperature is very much one of them. Better still, we could program a natural circadian lull and rise in temperature across the night that is in harmony with each body’s expectations, rather than the constant nighttime temperature set in most homes and apartments. Over time, we could intelligently curate a tailored thermal sleep environment that is personalized to the circadian rhythms of each individual occupant of each bedroom, departing from the unhelpful non-varying thermal backdrop that plagues the sleep of most people using standard home thermostats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 5108 - Over time, we could intelligently curate a tailored thermal sleep environment that is personalized to the circadian rhythms of each individual occupant of each bedroom, departing from the unhelpful non-varying thermal backdrop that plagues the sleep of most people using standard home thermostats. Both these changes require no effort from an individual, and should hasten the speed of sleep onset, increase total sleep time, and even deepen NREM-sleep quality for all household members (as discussed in chapter 13). The second passive solution concerns electric light. Many of us suffer from overexposure to nighttime light, particularly blue-dominant LED light from our digital devices. This evening digital light suppresses melatonin and delays our sleep timing. What if we can turn that problem into a solution? Soon, we should be able to engineer LED bulbs with filters that can vary the wavelength of light that they emit, ranging from warm yellow colors less harmful to melatonin, to strong blue light that powerfully suppresses it. Paired with sleep trackers that can accurately characterize our personal biological rhythms, we can install these new bulbs throughout a home, all connected to the home network. The lightbulbs (and even other networked LED-screen devices, such as iPads) would be instructed to gradually dial down the harmful blue light in the home as the evening progresses, based on an individual’s (or set of individuals’) natural sleep-wake pattern. We could do this dynamically and seamlessly as individuals move from one room to the next in real time. Here again we can intelligently split the difference on the fly based on the biophysiological mix of whoever is in the room. In doing so, the users’ own brains and bodies, measured and translated through the wearables to the networked home, would synergistically regulate light and thus melatonin release that promotes, rather than impedes, optimal regulation of sleep for one and</p>

Considering the health benefits of increased sleep amount, why don’t we institute a similar incentive for racking up more consistent and plentiful slumber? Health insurance companies could approve valid commercial sleep-tracking devices that individuals commonly own.</p>
