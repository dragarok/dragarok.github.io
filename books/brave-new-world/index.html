<li>
<p>loc 390 - He let out the amazing truth. For a very long period before the time of Our Ford, and even for some generations afterwards, erotic play between children had been regarded as abnormal (there was a roar of laughter); and not only abnormal, actually immoral (no!): and had therefore been rigorously suppressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 475 - Our Ford—or Our Freud, as, for some inscrutable reason, he chose to call himself whenever he spoke of psychological matters—Our Freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life.</p>

<li>
<p>loc 475 - Our Ford—or Our Freud, as, for some inscrutable reason, he chose to call himself whenever he spoke of psychological matters—Our Freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life. The world was full of fathers—was therefore full of misery; full of mothers—therefore of every kind of perversion from sadism to chastity; full of brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts—full of madness and suicide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 500 - “But seriously,” she said, “I really do think you ought to be careful. It’s such horribly bad form to go on and on like this with one man. At forty, or thirty-five, it wouldn’t be so bad. But at your age, Lenina! No, it really won’t do. And you know how strongly the D.H.C. objects to anything intense or long-drawn. Four months of Henry Foster, without having another man—why, he’d be furious if he knew . . .”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 504 - “Think of water under pressure in a pipe.” They thought of it. “I pierce it once,” said the Controller. “What a jet!” He pierced it twenty times. There were twenty piddling little fountains. “My baby. My baby . . .!” “Mother!” The madness is infectious. “My love, my one and only, precious, precious . . .” Mother, monogamy, romance. High spurts the fountain; fierce and foamy the wild jet. The urge has but a single outlet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 512 - “Of course there’s no need to give him up. Have somebody else from time to time, that’s all. He has other girls, doesn’t he?” Lenina admitted it. “Of course he does. Trust Henry Foster to be the perfect gentleman—always correct. And then there’s the Director to think of. You know what a stickler . . .” Nodding, “He patted me on the behind this afternoon,” said Lenina. “There, you see!” Fanny was triumphant. “That shows what he stands for. The strictest conventionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 538 - Feeling lurks in that interval of time between desire and its consummation. Shorten that interval, break down all those old unnecessary barriers. “Fortunate boys!” said the Controller. “No pains have been spared to make your lives emotionally easy—to preserve you, so far as that is possible, from having emotions at all.”</p>
