<ul>
<li>
<p>loc 286 - Hinging on my belief that everything happens for a reason—but that it is our responsibility to choose the most empowering reasons for the challenges, events and circumstances of our lives—I used my accident to fuel a triumphant comeback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 853 - Rearview Mirror Syndrome (RMS). Our subconscious minds are equipped with a self-limiting rearview mirror, through which we continuously relive and recreate our past. We mistakenly believe that who we were is who we are, thus limiting our true potential in the present, based on the limitations of our past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 923 - In his bestselling book The Rhythm of Life, Matthew Kelly enlightens us to a universal life purpose that I believe we should all live by:  to become the best version of ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 933 - One of the most prevalent, yet not-so-obvious causes of mediocrity is isolating incidents. We do this when we mistakenly assume that each choice we make, and each individual action we take, is only affecting that particular moment, or circumstance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 939 - We must realize that the real impact and consequence of each of our choices and actions—and even our thoughts—is monumental, because every single thought, choice, and action is determining who we are becoming, which will ultimately determine the quality of our lives. As T. Harv Eker said in his best-selling book Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, “How you do anything is how you do everything.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 941 - As T. Harv Eker said in his best-selling book Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, “How you do anything is how you do everything.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 941 - As T. Harv Eker said in his best-selling book Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, “How you do anything is how you do everything.” Every time you choose to do the easy thing, instead of the right thing, you are shaping your identity, becoming the type of person who does what’s easy, rather than what’s right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 960 - Always remember that who you’re becoming is far more important than what you’re doing, and yet it is what you’re doing that is determining who you’re becoming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1083 - Arguably the single most significant cause of mediocrity and unfulfilled potential, which prevents 95% of our society from creating and living the life they truly want, is that most people have no sense of urgency to improve themselves so they can improve their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1126 - Robin Sharma:  “One of the saddest things in life is to get to the end and look back in regret, knowing that you could have been, done, and had so much more.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1148 - We hit the snooze button and resist the inevitable act of waking up, unaware that our resistance is sending a message to the universe that we’d rather lie there in our beds—unconscious—than consciously and actively live and create the lives we say that we want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1198 - I’ve found that how we feel in the morning when we wake up—and this is a very important distinction—is not based on how many hours of sleep we got, as much as it’s based on how we told ourselves we were going to feel when we woke up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1224 - What I found was that whether I got nine, eight, seven, six, five, or even just four hours of sleep, as long as I consciously decided, before bed, that I was getting the perfect amount of sleep—that the hours were going to energize my body to feel wonderful in the morning—I consistently woke feeling better than I ever had before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1256 - It’s been said that nobody actually likes waking up early, but everyone loves the feeling of having woken up early.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1270 - The first key to waking up is to remember this:  Your first thought in the morning is usually the last thought you had before you went to bed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1270 - The first key to waking up is to remember this:  Your first thought in the morning is usually the last thought you had before you went to bed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1297 - Often when people feel tired—at any time of the day—what they really need is more water, not more sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1313 - Here’s a quick review of the 5-Step Snooze-Proof Wake Up Strategy to significantly increase your Wake Up Motivation Level (WUML):  1. Set Your Intentions the Night Before. This is the most important step. Remember:  your first thought in the morning is usually the last thought you had before bed, so take responsibility for creating genuine excitement for the next morning, every night before bed. 2. Keep Your Alarm Clock Across the Room. Remember:  Movement creates energy! 3. Brush Your Teeth. Use an antiseptic mouthwash to add extra umph! 4. Drink a Full Glass of Water. Hydrate yourself, ASAP! 5. Get Dressed. Or jump in the shower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1423 - Silence is the first practice of the Life S.A.V.E.R.S. and may be one of the most significant areas for improvement for our noisy, fast-paced and over-stimulated lifestyles. I’m referring to the life-transforming power of purposeful Silence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1449 - Here are some of my favorite activities to choose from and practice during my period of Silence, in no particular order, followed by a simple meditation to get you started:  Ö Meditation Ö Prayer Ö Reflection Ö Deep Breathing Ö Gratitude Some mornings I do just one of these activities, and other mornings I combine them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1460 - It is very important that you don’t stay in bed for this, and preferably that you leave your bedroom altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1521 - There’s no single right way to spend time in Silence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1521 - There’s no single right way to spend time in Silence. You can pray, meditate, focus on what you’re grateful for, or even engage in deep thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1536 - A is for Affirmations It’s the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. Once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen. —MUHAMMAD ALI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1536 - A is for Affirmations It’s the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. Once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen. —MUHAMMAD ALI You will be a failure, until you impress the subconscious with the conviction you are a success. This is done by making an affirmation, which clicks. —FLORENCE SCOVEL SHINN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1587 - It had been 7 years since my car accident, and while this belief was based on my reality then, it was time to let it go. Maybe my memory was so horrible, at least in part, because I had never made the effort to believe it could improve. As Henry Ford said, “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right either way.” If affirmations could change what was, to me, the most justified limiting belief that I had, then they could probably change anything. So, I created my first affirmation which read: I am letting go of the limiting belief that I have a horrible memory. My brain is a miraculous organism capable of healing itself, and my memory can improve, but only in proportion to how much I believe it can improve. So, from this moment on, I am maintaining the unwavering belief that I have an excellent memory, and it’s continuing to get better every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1589 - As Henry Ford said, “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right either way.” If affirmations could change what was, to me, the most justified limiting belief that I had, then they could probably change anything. So, I created my first affirmation which read: I am letting go of the limiting belief that I have a horrible memory.

</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1643 - Being (who you need to be) and doing (what you need to do) are prerequisites for having what you want to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1659 - What Got You Here Won’t Get You There by Marshal Goldsmith. It reads, “The #1 skill of influencers is the sincere effort to make a person feel that he or she is the most important person in the world. It’s one of the skills that Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, and Bruce Goodman used to become the best in their fields. I will do this for every person I connect with!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1665 - Anytime you see or hear a quote that inspires you, or come across an empowering philosophy or strategy and think to yourself:  Man, that is a huge area of improvement for me, add it to your affirmations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1703 - Visualization, also known as creative visualization or mental rehearsal, refers to the practice of seeking to generate positive results in your outer world by using your imagination to create mental pictures of specific behaviors and outcomes occurring in your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1716 - Jim Carrey, who wrote himself a check in 1987 in the amount of 10 million dollars. He dated it for “Thanksgiving 1995” and added in the memo line, “For acting services rendered.”  He then visualized it for years, and in 1994 he was paid 10 million dollars for his starring role in Dumb and Dumber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1731 - Directly after reading your affirmations—where you took the time to articulate and focus on your goals and who you need to be to take your life to the next level—is the prime time to visualize yourself living in alignment with your affirmations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1741 - Many people don’t feel comfortable visualizing success and are even scared to succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1744 - This famous quote from Marianne Williamson’s bestselling book, A Return To Love, may resonate with anyone who feels mental or emotional obstacles when attempting to visualize:  “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1789 - If you’d like detailed instructions on this process, Christine Kane has an excellent blog on How To Make A Vision Board as well as a free eBook titled The Complete Guide To Vision Boards. Both are available on her website at <a href="https://www.ChristineKane.com">www.ChristineKane.com</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1860 - Reading, the fifth practice in the Life S.A.V.E.R.S., is the fast track to transforming any area of your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1916 - There is more value in re-reading a book you already know has strategies that can improve your life than there is in reading a new book before you’ve mastered the strategies in the first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1935 - My favorite form of Scribing is journaling, which I do for 5-10 minutes during my Miracle Morning. By getting your thoughts out of your head and putting them in writing, you gain valuable insights you’d otherwise never see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1965 - Then, I began to tap into the highest point of value I would gain from reviewing my journals. I pulled out a sheet of blank paper, drew a line down the middle, and wrote two headings at the top:  Lessons Learned and New Commitments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1988 - High achievers are typically the worst at this, constantly overlooking or minimizing their accomplishments, beating themselves up over every mistake and imperfection, and never feeling like anything they do is quite good enough. The irony is that gap-focus is a big part of the reason that high achievers are high achievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 1995 - The highest achievers—those who are balanced and focused on achieving Level 10 success in nearly every area of their lives—are exceedingly grateful for what they have, regularly acknowledge themselves for what they’ve accomplished, and are always at peace with where they are in their lives. It’s the dueling idea that I am doing the best that I can in this moment, and at the same time, I can and will do better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2227 - In his bestselling book Eat That Frog, the legendary productivity expert Brian Tracy shows how getting things done in the morning leads to mental rewards that can take us to great heights in our lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2227 - In his bestselling book Eat That Frog, the legendary productivity expert Brian Tracy shows how getting things done in the morning leads to mental rewards that can take us to great heights in our lives. It is the idea that doing the hard task first (“frog eating”) and getting it out of the way creates momentum and makes the rest of the day more productive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2280 - Successful people aren’t born that way. They become successful by establishing the habit of doing things unsuccessful people don’t like to do. The successful people don’t always like doing these things themselves; they just get on and do them. —DON MARQUIS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2280 - Successful people aren’t born that way. They become successful by establishing the habit of doing things unsuccessful people don’t like to do. The successful people don’t always like doing these things themselves; they just get on and do them. —DON MARQUIS Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going. —JIM ROHN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loc 2369 - Those experts are partly correct. It does take 21 days—the first two phases—to form a new habit. But the third 10-day phase is crucial to sustaining your new habit, long term. The final 10 days is where you positively reinforce and associate pleasure with your new habit. You’ve been primarily associating pain and discomfort with it during the first 20 days. Instead of hating and resisting your new habit, you start feeling proud of yourself for making it this far. Phase Three is also where the actual transformation occurs, as your new habit becomes part of your identity. It transcends the space between something you’re trying and who you’re becoming. You start to see yourself as someone who lives the habit.</p>
